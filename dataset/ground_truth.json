            "CLAIM: Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency called the U.S. Air Force an “enemy” of Israel in a post on X after an active-duty member of the military branch set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C.",
            "AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The account that made the post is not affiliated with Mossad and has previously published erroneous claims about Israel. Mossad’s official X account, to which the agency’s website links, has not posted anything since September 2020.",
            "THE FACTS: After 25-year-old airman Aaron Bushnell self-immolated outside the Israeli Embassy, while declaring he “will not longer be complicit in genocide,” social media users alleged that Mossad had denigrated the U.S. Air Force on X in response.",
            "Many posts shared a screenshot of two posts from an account called “Mossad Commentary.” One includes an image of Bushnell on fire captioned with the widely-used expression, in Hebrew, “Am Yisrael chai,” meaning “the people of Israel live.” The second, made in response to the first, states: “Our enemies kill themselves.”",
            "The first post had been deleted by Monday afternoon, but an archived version shows that it was still up early in the morning. The second post remains live on the platform.",
            "“BREAKING: Mossad labels United States Air Force an ENEMY to the state of @Israel,” reads an X post from a different account that included the screenshot. It had received more than 10,600 likes and shares on Monday.",
            "But Mossad Commentary, which uses Mossad’s logo as its profile picture, is not affiliated with the Israeli intelligence agency and has previously made false claims about the Jewish state. For example, a post from October 2023 states that Yemen had “officially” declared war on Israel. The Associated Press reported at the time that Yemen’s internationally recognized government had done no such thing.",
            "Another post from the account called Bushnell “an idiot” after he set himself on fire.",
            "Mossad’s website links to its official X account, which is called in Hebrew “The Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks.” The most recent post is from September 2020.",
            "The Israeli military said Mossad Commentary is “clearly not an official account” in response to an email query from the AP. Mossad Commentary did not respond to a message from the AP on X.",
            "Bushnell died from his injuries. According to AP reporting, he had walked to the embassy shortly before 1 p.m. on Sunday and began livestreaming on Twitch, a video streaming platform. Law enforcement officials believe he set his phone down and then doused himself in accelerant and ignited the flames.",
            "Israel has adamantly denied genocide allegations and says it is carrying out operations in the Israel-Hamas war in accordance with international law.",

We’ll all miss her, as I know her family will.”",

            "The parade was intended to celebrate another milestone accomplishment for the Chiefs — becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl champions since New England in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Instead, it sent the Chiefs and their city into an offseason full of heavy hearts.",
            "“Before we get into the football topics, I’d like to definitely start off by offering our thoughts and prayers to Lisa Lopez-Galvan and her family, all the families that were impacted the day of the parade,” Veach said. “Certainly, a heartbreaking and tragic day for us. Our organization has been in contact with the families, and we will continue to do so and be a pillar of support for them both now and into the future.”",
            "Veach went on to thank the first responders who tended to the victims and helped bystanders navigate their way to safety.",

We can turn this, which was a negative, into a real positive. With just a little togetherness and love, we can fix a lot of problems.”",

            "Under the plan, member states would have to meet restoration targets for specific habitats and species, with the aim of covering at least 20% of the region’s land and sea areas by 2030. But quarrels over exemptions and flexibility clauses allowing member states to skirt the rules plagued negotiations.",
            "The bill was adopted earlier by a 329-275 vote with 24 abstentions after the center-right Christian Democratic European People’s Party of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen decided to vote against it.",

            "A major part of that is its plan to sell off AirAsia's core short-haul aviation business, comprising several regional subsidiaries, from Capital A Berhad to its Malaysia-listed sister firm Air Asia X — its mid- to long-haul business. That will create a unified Air Asia Group, Fernandes said, which is targeting a $400 million equity raise, according to Reuters.",
            "Subject to regulatory approval, the deal finalized Wednesday with Aetherium Acquisition Corp.— a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC — will result in Capital A International going public on the Nasdaq stock exchange. A SPAC is a publicly traded company formed solely to merge with or acquire another company, providing it with a swifter path to a stock market listing.",

            "\"Why a SPAC? I see it really as a reverse listing in America,\" Fernandes said. \"SPACs have got a bad name because a lot of these were, I'm going to be frank, hair-brained business schemes, sending people to the moon… We're generating real cash flow, real profits,\" he added.",
            "On a smaller scale, AirAsia's path will mirror that of Singapore-based, Southeast Asia-focused Grab, a \"super app\" service which began trading on the Nasdaq in Dec. 2021 after closing a SPAC merger.",

Anyone could submit a nomination on behalf of any woman from any company or organization with at least $25 million in revenue in at least one of the past three years or an enterprise value of at least $100 million. Nominees/nominators were asked to complete a detailed nomination form. This questionnaire contained quantitative and qualitative information which was used as the basis for CNBC's evaluation.",

This could be anything from launching a new product or service, to leading a turnaround effort, to sparking a viral cultural moment or movement. Whatever it was, it was important in the selection process that we identify a reason why each woman named to the list deserved the honor this year. Next year, we'll choose a whole new list of 50 women, and it is entirely possible that many of those women were nominated this year.",
            "In all, CNBC received more than 700 nominations from women across the business and cultural landscape, from companies and organizations ranging from small startups to the world's most valuable multinationals.",
            "The evaluation of the 700-plus nominees began with a quantitative assessment. Nominees were evaluated on five broad categories: results of the achievement in 2023; influence of the individual woman leader; reach of the company/organization, representation, and experience. Nominee scores in each category were then weighted according to a survey completed by members of the Changemakers Advisory Board. The board determined that \"Results\" and \"Influence\" were the most important categories, while \"Experience\" was given the lowest weighting of the five categories.",
            "After the quantitative evaluation, approximately one-third of the nominees were selected to move forward to a second round, which included a qualitative assessment, based on their weighted total scores. To move on to round two, nominees either scored in the top 25% overall, scored in the top 25% in a key category (such as \"startup founder\" or \"nonprofit CEO\"), or they received a recommendation from one or more of the Advisory Board members as part of their initial survey.",
            "For round two, the remaining nominees were divided into groups of 30 for qualitative assessment. A team of CNBC editorial staff, along with members of the Advisory Board, read the responses submitted with each nomination and assigned up to five points for each of three criteria. These were:",
            "Contribution: Looking specifically at the response to \"Contribution to the business world in 2023,\" scorers assessed the contribution the applicant made to the business world, and to broader society, last year.",
            "Transformational Change: Scorers were to assess whether the specific contribution, as well as the balance of the nominee's work, and the manner in which that work is done, represents a fundamental shift in the way business gets done. More specifically, scorers were asked to look for ways in which nominees reject traditional male archetypes of business leadership and lead with their own authentic, unique strengths.",
            "Inspiring Leader: Scorers were asked whether the applicant's story inspires them, and whether it will inspire her employees, customers and investors.",
            "Qualitative scores were added to the quantitative score from round one, with each weighted equally (50% qualitative, 50% quantitative), and nominees were re-ranked according to their total scores.",
            "A smaller group of CNBC editorial senior staff performed a final editorial review, which involved some additional research, discussion and debate to determine the final 50 nominees to make the list. This being the first year, extra scrutiny was applied to the quantitative methodology and the qualitative review to account for potential irregularities in the data as well as for any personal biases. However, two-thirds of the women named to the list ranked in the top 50 before our editorial review.",

It includes 15 startup CEOs and founders whose companies have a total valuation of more than $47 billion, and 11 public company CEOs overseeing firms with a combined market cap of about $170 billion. In addition, it features five women deploying technology to amplify the philanthropic impact of their organizations and four women shaking up the world of sports business. Nearly one-fifth of the women are based outside the U.S.",
            "Each has accomplished a meaningful achievement in 2023, propelling a major business to a new level of growth and often tackling issues of significant importance to society.",
            "Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, secured key manufacturing capacity at the dawn of a blockbuster weight-loss drug era and worked to lower the prices for insulin drugs amid heightened political scrutiny of prescription costs. RePurpose Global CEO and co-founder Svanika Balasubramanian is working to minimize and repurpose plastic waste alongside hundreds of consumer brands. Bobbie CEO Laura Modi has taken on the baby formula shortage with a new product, while Baby2Baby co-CEOs Norah Weinstein and Kelly Sawyer Patricof are upending the status quo in diaper manufacturing and distribution.",
            "In some cases, Changemakers are taking their star power to build out new market opportunities. Alex Cooper is changing the podcast business and building a new kind of audio media empire. Actor Tracee Ellis Ross is changing the hair-care industry and more with Pattern Beauty. Naomi Osaka is shaking things up both on the tennis court and off with her media company and skincare line.",
            "In reviewing the Changemakers, CNBC identified a couple of key trends. First, this new generation of women leaders is aligning purpose and profits, creating businesses that succeed when they achieve environmental or social good. At rePurpose Global, Balasubramanian created a model that succeeds when companies take steps to reduce their plastic production and environmental impact. Jessica Chang, the CEO of Upwards, is reimagining the business of child care to make it more widely accessible and affordable. Maayan Cohen created Hello Heart to help individuals manage cardiovascular health, while helping employers manage costs.",
            "Changemakers are also reformers, inventing new approaches to fix broken systems. And many of them are providing female consumers with new, much-needed options in areas that have often been overlooked. Kate Ryder is closing major gaps in women's and family health care with Maven. Mielle Organics founder Monique Rodriguez created new options for natural hair care. National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jessica Berman is proving the broad appeal of women's sports and closing the pay gap among professional athletes.",
            "And we're seeing several women forge new paths in renewable energy, such as Dandelion Energy CEO Kathy Hannun, who is working to create a new market for geothermal energy, and Twelve's Etosha Cave, who is focused on turning CO2 and water into aviation fuel.",
            "While women continue to be underrepresented in the world of technology, and particularly in the cutting-edge area of artificial intelligence, several of this year's Changemakers are playing key roles in using AI to improve and accelerate their businesses and others. Clara Shih, as the CEO of Salesforce AI, is helping companies deploy AI across their organizations. Michelle Zatlyn, co-founder and chief operating officer at Cloudflare, is giving companies AI tools to bolster cybersecurity and lower costs for vulnerable, critical infrastructure providers, including schools and local election systems. Kristin Peck, CEO of animal health company Zoetis, is using AI to improve outcomes for pets and their owners.",
            "All these women are trailblazers in their fields, with inspiring stories and unique approaches. The Changemakers serve as a reminder that success is a result of leading in ways that are authentic."

            "[Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.]",
            "[In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.]",
            "[Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.]",
            "When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.",
            "The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.",
            "That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.",
            "As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.",
            "Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.",
            "TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION",
            "Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.",
            "Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.",
            "\"We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,\" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.\"",
            "The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.",
            "The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.",
            "Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.",
            "\"If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,\" Kim said.",
            "Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.",
            "\"I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,\" she said. \"I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.\"",
            "She added: \"Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.\"",
            "REPUBLICAN HOPES",
            "The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.",
            "Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.",
            "Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.",
            "Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send \"ticked off\" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.",
            "A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.",
            "\"We’ll come together,\" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. \"The threat from Republicans is too much.\""

This illegitimate inquiry should have ended long before their star witness was indicted for lying but it wasn’t. Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is - on the record and under oath - this political charade should finally come to an end.\"",
            "Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Wednesday.",
            "The first son testified that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in a \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry against his father. He also said Republicans have no evidence against his father, the president, \"because there isn't any.\"",
            "Comer, R-Ky., made a public statement Wednesday afternoon, saying that Hunter’s appearance \"was a great deposition for us.\"",
            "Hunter Biden, however, thought the deposition went well for him. On his way out of the hearing room Wednesday, Hunter Biden told reporters he thought the hearing went \"great.\"",
            "A source with direct knowledge of the deposition told Fox News Digital that Hunter Biden \"first made clear in his opening statement and emphasized throughout the deposition, Joe Biden was not involved in, did not benefit from, and took no official actions to benefit any of his business ventures.\"",
            "Regarding the infamous \"10 held by H for the big guy?\" email, the source said Hunter told the committee that his associate who sent the message, James Gilliar, was \"out of his mind for even suggesting Joe Biden get involved in their joint venture.\"",
            "\"Hunter discussed his addiction at length,\" the source said, adding that Hunter \"admitted that he was high or drunk when he sent the ‘sitting here with my father’ WhatsApp message, sent it to the wrong recipient, and is now embarrassed by the message.\"",
            "That text was sent to a business partner for Chinese energy firm CEFC.",
            "The source said Hunter also testified that his dad \"was not sitting next to him.\"",
            "But Comer said after the deposition that \"it proves several bits of our evidence that we've been conducting throughout this investigation.\"",
            "Comer added that \"there are also some contradictory statements that I think need further review.\"",
            "\"So this impeachment inquiry will now go to the next phase, which will be a public hearing,\" Comer said.",
            "Comer stressed that Hunter Biden and his attorney have \"demanded\" a public hearing following the deposition.",
            "\"Just as I said, when we said we were going to do the deposition first, we will have a public hearing next,\" he explained. \"So I think that the public hearing hopefully will clear up some discrepancies between some of the statements that were made between some of the associates and what we heard today.\"",
            "Indeed, Lowell said back in November 2023, \"Hunter is eager to have the opportunity, in a public forum and at the right time, to discuss these matters with the Committee.\"",
            "Comer said \"all in all,\" he is \"very optimistic, very excited about this deposition.\"",
            "\"I look forward to releasing the transcripts as soon as both sides agree to that,\" Comer said, hinting that the first son’s transcript of his deposition could be released to the public by the end of the week. \"Hopefully that'll be within the next 2 or 3 days.\"",
            "During his opening statement Wednesday, obtained by Fox News, Hunter Biden testified that he was present \"to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business.\"",
            "\"Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never,\" he stressed. \"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any.\"",
            "The first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"",
            "\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.",
            "Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.",
            "House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.",

            "[Biden is hoping to address his deep unpopularity on immigration]",
            "President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.",
            "Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
            "Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.",
            "Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.",
            "CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.",
            "Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in Fiscal Year 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.",
            "Eagle Pass has also been the center of an ongoing standoff and court battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the administration over border-related issues, including setting up razor-wire and a new anti-illegal immigration law.",
            "The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.",
            "\"He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said aboard Air Force One on Wednesday. \"He will reiterate his calls for congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.",

            "AudioFile Magazine praised the audio version of Senator Sherrod Brown’s latest book as \"intriguing,\" not just for the Ohio Democrat’s prose, but the \"thoughtful tone\" of co-narrator Leon Nixon.",
            "That silky voice is perhaps best known for a number of erotic novels, including Hood Boyz Fall In Love Too 3, Nobody Can Love You Like Them Roughnecks Do 2, Fallin' For a Miami Hustla 3, and Mated to the Cyborgs.",
            "Nixon, a former police captain, has made a name for himself narrating steamy novels that have received thousands of reviews on Amazon. Those books are considerably more popular than Brown’s Desk 88: Eight Progressive Senators Who Changed America, which is ranked 919,374th on Amazon’s best seller charts.",
            "Brown devotes each chapter of Desk 88 to a different senator who once sat at his desk. At several points throughout the book, Brown quotes lawmakers using the N-word. The pallid Brown, whose narration is limited to the chapter titles, lets the African-American Nixon read the slur, which comes twice from the Mississippi Democrat Theodore Bilbo, once from strategist Lee Atwater, and once from former vice president Al Gore, who was himself quoting Strom Thurmond.",
            "A spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Among the figures Brown profiles is former Ku Klux Klan member and Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, whom the senator calls a \"complicated but necessary inclusion in a book about great progressives who sat at Desk 88.\"",
            "Fortunately for Brown, Nixon is no stranger to controversy. His voice often divides audiobook lovers, who carry out heated debates in the Amazon comments section. Reviewers were split on Nixon’s narration of What Happens on Vacation: A Flirty Vacation Romance, which details the fictitious African-American senator Jessup Outlaw’s winter romance.",
            "One listener dismisses Nixon’s voice as \"boring,\" while another calls him \"soothing,\" and praises him for guiding \"readers into discovering love.\"",
            "Nixon’s best performance, according to Amazon reviews, comes in The Right Player: A Sports Romance. One fan said Nixon’s voice was \"perfect for an evening on the couch. With your eyes closed so, you can listen and see the story unfold in your imagination.\"",
            "Listeners also raved about Her Naughty Suitor (Falling for a Rose), in which Nixon voices a real estate mogul with a \"desirous craving to explore everything about\" the book’s female protagonist.",
            "\"Oh my Gawd!! Lord, help me. I need a cigarette or a drink after reading ‘Her Naughty Suitor.’ And I don't smoke nor drink,\" one reviewer wrote on Amazon. \"I LOVED IT!!!!\"",
            "Brown is not the first Democrat to intersect with the world of romance novels. Two-time failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams once moonlit as a romance writer, cranking out books including Never Tell, the tale of a criminal psychologist who falls in love with a journalist as they seek to uncover the identity of a serial killer.",
            "Nor is Brown’s book the first foray into politics for Nixon, who took a break from bodice-rippers to help narrate an audiobook of the January 6th report."

            "Cornyn, 72, served as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) between 2009 and 2013, and he said he \"laid the foundation\" for Republicans to take control of the Senate in 2014. He also served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019, and he highlighted in the announcement that he helped secure the confirmations of Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh under former president Donald Trump.",
            "\"We will improve communication, increase transparency, and ensure inclusion of every member’s expertise and opinion,\" he promised. \"We will restore the important role of Senate committees and reestablish the regular appropriations process, rather than lurch from one crisis to another. And we will return power back to our members; there will be no more backroom deals or forced votes on bills without adequate time for review, debate, and amendment.\"",
            "Cornyn, the first to publicly announce his intent to run, is one of several Republicans who could take the leadership role left by McConnell, who announced Wednesday he would step down as the GOP leader in November. Minority whip Sen. John Thune (S.D.) and Senate conference chair John Barrasso (Wyo.) are expected to seek the position. Other potential successors include Sen. Steve Daines (Mont.), now the leader of the NRSC, as well as former NRSC chair Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.) and conference vice chair Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), according to the Washington Post."

            "The war in Ukraine has triggered the worst crisis in Moscow's relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Putin has previously spoken of the dangers of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, but his nuclear warning on Thursday was one of his most explicit.",
            "Addressing lawmakers and other members of the country's elite, Putin, 71, repeated his accusation that the West was bent on weakening Russia, and he suggested Western leaders did not understand how dangerous their meddling could be in what he cast as Russia's own internal affairs.",
            "He prefaced his nuclear warning with a specific reference to an idea, floated by French president Emmanuel Macron on Monday, of European NATO members sending ground troops to Ukraine—a suggestion that was quickly rejected by the United States, Germany, Britain, and others.",
            "\"[Western nations] must realize that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilization. Don't they get that?!\" said Putin.",

            "\"Strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness,\" he said, noting that new-generation hypersonic nuclear weapons he first spoke about in 2018 had either been deployed or were at a stage where development and testing were being completed.",
            "Visibly angry, Putin suggested Western politicians recall the fate of those like Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler and France's Napoleon Bonaparte who had unsuccessfully invaded Russia in the past.",
            "\"But now the consequences will be far more tragic,\" said Putin. \"They think [war] is a cartoon,\" he said, accusing Western politicians of forgetting what real war meant because they had not faced the same security challenges as Russians had in the last three decades.",
            "Russian forces now had the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine and were advancing in several places, Putin said. Russia must also boost the troops it has deployed along its western borders with the European Union after Finland and Sweden decided to join the NATO military alliance, he added.",
            "The veteran Kremlin leader dismissed Western suggestions that Russian forces might go beyond Ukraine and attack European countries as \"nonsense.\" He also said Moscow would not repeat the mistake of the Soviet Union and allow the West to \"drag\" it into an arms race that would eat up too much of its budget.",
            "\"Therefore, our task is to develop the defense-industrial complex in such a way as to increase the scientific, technological, and industrial potential of the country,\" he said.",

            "It would be standard campaign fare for a Democrat, but Barger is a lifelong Republican — albeit one who laments her party’s takeover by “a radical side.”",
            "Winning elections in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County is difficult at best for most Republicans, but Barger has won twice, boosted by generally moderate positions and a willingness to work with the four Democrats she serves with on the Board of Supervisors, three of whom have endorsed her.",
            "The challenge has grown a bit steeper since redistricting in 2021 tilted the sprawling 5th District slightly less conservative. Some neighborhoods in the northwest San Fernando Valley were removed, while more liberal L.A. neighborhoods came in.",
            "So as Barger faces off against four opponents, led by Assemblymember Chris Holden (D-Pasadena), she and her backers have emphasized her Planned Parenthood endorsement and moderate stances on issues that might appeal to Democratic or independent voters.",
            "Holden, meanwhile, has claimed in campaign materials that Barger “supports Donald Trump’s MAGA agenda” — which she denies — and has pointed to choices Barger has made that he said underscore her Republican values.",
            "“His best bet is to actually tag her as a Trump Republican or a partisan Republican, even if it’s not accurate in terms of her voting record — she does often vote with the other Democrats who are on the board — but it’s a really good way to actually try to attack her because she’s so well known in the whole district,” said Christian Grose, academic director at the USC Schwarzenegger Institute.",
            "Supervisor races are nonpartisan, meaning the political parties of candidates aren’t listed on ballots. Instead, voters see only their job titles. The top two finishers will have a November runoff if no one receives more than 50% of the primary vote.",
            "Barger, a county employee since the late 1980s, and Holden, who has held public office for about 35 years, are the best known candidates in the race. If Barger wins, this would be her final term because of term limits.",
            "The other three are Burbank City Council member Konstantine Anthony, civic technologist and businessman Marlon Marroquin, and attorney and nonprofit leader Perry Goldberg, who has slammed Barger for trying to play both sides.",
            "Of the 1.2 million registered voters in the 5th District, 46% are Democrats, up from 43% before redistricting in 2021, according to county election data. About 25% are Republicans, down from 26%, and about 23% have no party preference, down from about 26%.",
            "“There’s not dramatic changes, though I do think going from [43%] to 46% [Democrats], in a close election, that’s the margin, even though it’s not a huge change,” said Grose, a political science and public policy professor at USC.",
            "Most races in L.A. County involve moderate Democrats being challenged by more liberal members of their own party, said Raphael Sonenshein, a longtime researcher of California politics. The 5th District offers the rare opportunity for a moderate Republican like Barger to be successful.",
            "“But the candidate who would be identified as more Republican really has to sidestep the downside of being a Republican in California when party is on people’s minds,” said Sonenshein, executive director of the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation, which finances social science research.",
            "The focus on the support from Planned Parenthood could help Barger court Democrats and other left-leaning voters, especially female and LGBTQ+ voters, experts said.",
            "“Her opponents sense that her voters tend [to lean] more left, and they want to paint Barger as a Trump devotee, based on those mailers, and a clear way for Barger to dispel doubts about her Trump allegiance is to focus on a core issue for Democrats, especially Democratic women: her support for reproductive rights,” said Jennifer M.

In 2016, Stein’s vote was larger than Trump’s margin in three swing states, causing Democrats to charge that she cost Hillary Clinton the election. How many of Stein’s voters might have voted for Clinton is unknown, but the risk of third-party candidates drawing support away from Biden has haunted Democrats.",
            "A third independent candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had 11% support in the poll, but his voters were almost evenly split between Trump and Biden as their second choice.",
            "Those candidates, especially West and Stein, may have more impact in California than elsewhere in the country because of the state’s liberal electorate, noted Mark DiCamillo, the director of the Berkeley IGS poll.",
            "The impact of those candidates could fade by November — that typically happens. They may not even make the ballot in some swing states. Each state sets its own rules for ballot access — some, including California, are easy, others are very difficult, and the deadline remains months away.",
            "But the large number of voters who currently say they would vote for a third-party or independent candidate is a “measure of the disaffection” with Biden, DiCamillo said.",

Biden’s support has dropped 24 points among voters who identify themselves as moderates, 15 points among those who call themselves somewhat liberal and 16 points among the strongly liberal.",

            "“The younger voters are a key segment in this election,” said DiCamillo. A 30-point decline “is huge,” DiCamillo said, and underscores the concern among Democrats that many younger voters “may just decide not to vote.”",
            "Even if that wouldn’t cause Biden to lose the state, Democrats further down the ballot fear that a lower turnout could lead to Democratic losses in closely fought swing congressional districts. California has at least four districts that both parties consider toss-ups, enough to potentially determine which party controls the House next year.",
            "To the extent that the poll has good news for Biden, it’s this: His standing with voters may have bottomed out. After rising consistently in polls over the last three years, the share who see him unfavorably, 49%, hasn’t changed from the last Times-Berkeley IGS poll in early January.",
            "Moreover, in a reelection match against Trump, who is also very unpopular, Biden can still win voters who have an unfavorable view of him. Of the voters who back Biden in a head-to-head matchup with Trump, about 1 in 6 view the president unfavorably. About two-thirds of those who said they remained undecided also disapprove of Biden.",

            "In the early voting states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, Haley got a lot of her support from independent voters. But they can’t participate in California’s Republican primary.

            "Insurance industry groups have called it a “bomb-throwing bogus advocacy” group, a “publicity-seeking, dark money front,” and an organization out to protect its own “financial $elf-interest$.”",
            "These are the kinds of attacks that Harvey Rosenfield and Consumer Watchdog, the advocacy group he founded nearly 40 years ago, have come to expect.",
            "But in the last year, as home insurers have stopped writing new policies and retreated from parts of the state prone to wildfire, a new voice has joined the ranks of critics who say Harvey and Co. are making things worse: California’s elected insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, whose office has called Consumer Watchdog an entrenched interest group “defending its own piggy bank.”",
            "If attacking a public advocacy group seems like an odd stance for an elected official, it’s made even odder by the fact that Lara wouldn’t have his job if it weren’t for Consumer Watchdog.",
            "To understand the beef, you need to understand Proposition 103, a California law governing the insurance industry.",
            "The campaign for that ballot measure in 1988 was one of the first missions of Consumer Watchdog, which formed in the wake of Ralph Nader’s success in spurring new consumer regulation.",
            "That proposition, which Rosenfield helped write, enacted some of the most stringent insurance industry regulation in the nation. First, it created the office of an elected insurance commissioner to head the state Department of Insurance. Any time an insurance company seeks to raise prices, Proposition 103 requires that the firm apply to the commissioner for prior approval.",
            "The goal, according to the text of the act, is to provide transparency into the insurance market and prevent insurers from charging “excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory” rates to policyholders.",
            "Nearly 35 years after Proposition 103 went into effect, Californians pay less for auto and home insurance than most Americans, with the state ranking among the bottom half of states for prices in both categories. But insurers say that long processing times for rate increases, among other regulations, have made it difficult to do business in the state as inflation and wildfire risks are on the rise.",
            "One specific criticism of Consumer Watchdog revolves around a unique proviso of Proposition 103. The law allows public groups such as Consumer Watchdog to intervene in an insurance company’s application for a rate increase and argue — alongside the Department of Insurance — for what the ultimate price should be.",
            "When groups such as Consumer Watchdog intervene, Proposition 103 stipulates that they can get paid for their efforts. After paying the intervening groups, insurance companies wind up passing those fees along to consumers. Insurance companies argue that this provides Consumer Watchdog and others a perverse incentive to turn every rate filing into a battle in order to get paid their fees.",
            "“No other state has this kind of public participation and scrutiny built into the regulatory process, which is why Prop 103 is their number one target,” Rosenfield said. “It drives them nuts.”",
            "“It comes down to the money, right?” said Carmen Balber, Consumer Watchdog’s executive director. “Thanks to the intervenor process, consumers pay less for their home and auto insurance than they would otherwise, and the industry has sought to claw back those profits for decades now.”",
            "There has been friction between the insurance industry and consumer groups for decades, but things have recently started to boil over.",
            "The American Property Casualty Insurance Assn., the nation’s largest insurance lobbying group, bankrolled a new website attacking Consumer Watchdog in late 2023. Spokespeople for the Insurance Information Institute and the Personal Insurance Federation of California regularly opine to reporters that Rosenfield, Balber and the group’s president, Jamie Court, are wrenches in the underwriting machinery.",
            "“The industry is going after Consumer Watchdog harder than normal,” said Brian Sullivan, owner and editor of insurance industry publication Risk Information. And the feud between the group and the Department of Insurance keeps escalating. “I have never seen the relationship degrade to the point it’s at now,” Sullivan said.",
            "The industry groups have been pushing for changes in Sacramento and at the Department of Insurance — and at the close of last year’s legislative session, saw some results in the forms of promises to loosen regulations.",
            "Lara, the state’s insurance commissioner, has had a rocky relationship with Consumer Watchdog from the start. After he pledged to not accept campaign funds from insurers in his first run for the office in 2018, a San Diego Union-Tribune investigation revealed that Lara had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from people and companies with ties to the insurance industry. Consumer Watchdog filed a public records request for communications between Lara’s department and the insurance companies linked to the donations, and then sued the commissioner for allegedly failing to respond to the request in full. The group lost its initial lawsuit, but is continuing to fight it in the state Courts of Appeal.",
            "Since then, the group has accused Lara’s office of ramming through rate increases without adequate review or opportunity for public input, and called his plans to change regulations with the goal of bringing more insurers back to the state market a “sham.”",
            "Lara, in turn, noted in a news conference announcing his proposed reforms that “bombastic statements from entrenched interest groups” help no one, and that “one entity can unreasonably prolong rate filings” while “materially benefiting from a process that is meant for broader public participation.”",
            "Michael Soller, Lara’s spokesperson with the department, has been less coy about the “entity” in question. After Consumer Watchdog accused Lara of striking a secret deal with insurance companies in the fall, Soller put out a statement saying that the group’s “cynical claims hide the truth that [it] has earned millions of dollars signing off on rate increases — while denying the reality that insurance has become impossible for some Californians to find at any price.” He added that the group “is turning a blind eye to consumers’ needs while defending its own insurance piggy bank.”",
            "Yes, they’re a big pain, but that’s their job.",
            "&mdash; Rep. John Garamendi, describing Consumer Watchdog",
            "While other consumer groups such as United Policyholders and the Consumer Federation of California have taken a more measured approach, Rosenfield has been blunt. “A commissioner more disposed to protect the industry has come along,” Rosenfield said. “Ultimately, there’s accountability for that within our system of democracy.”",
            "“He’s kind of out a little bit on his own on this in terms of opposing what Lara’s doing,” said Brian Sullivan of Risk Information.",
            "Increasingly, Consumer Watchdog is one of the only consumer advocates even participating in the Proposition 103 process. In the early days of the regime, half a dozen or so major consumer groups were willing to enter the fray. But over time, the pool of dedicated groups with the resources to fight long regulatory battles and only get paid months (and sometimes years) after their work begins, has dwindled to a handful. Now state records show that 75% of the time, if there’s an intervening entity in a rate filing, it’s Consumer Watchdog.",
            "This is where the accusation of self-interest comes to bear. Since Rosenfield helped write Proposition 103, he also wrote in the fee mechanism that pays his salary at Consumer Watchdog. According to critics, that amounts to self-dealing at the consumers’ expense.",
            "State records show that over the last two decades, the group has been paid $11.6 million in fees by the state for its interventions in rate filings, or an average of $575,000 each year. Proposition 103 isn’t Consumer Watchdog’s only policy focus, nor is it the group’s only source of revenue. Consumer Watchdog brought in $3.75 million in revenue in 2022 from donations, grants and other sources, according to public filings.",
            "For that $11.6 million Proposition 103 payout, the group has been party to saving consumers $5.51 billion in the last two decades, according to an analysis produced by Consumer Watchdog. In the last five years, Consumer Watchdog says its actions have contributed to $2.1 billion in savings for Californians. The group arrived at these figures by comparing the dollar value of rate increases that insurance companies sought in the last 22 years against the final amount they got when Consumer Watchdog challenged their request.",
            "In the last two years, when Consumer Watchdog intervened in a company’s request to raise its rates, the final result for ratepayers ended up 38% lower than what the companies requested for home insurance, and 29% lower for auto insurance, on average. When Consumer Watchdog didn’t enter the fray, the final amount approved by the state insurance department was only 2-3% lower than what companies requested on average, according to the report.",
            "Soller, the insurance department spokesperson, calls these numbers “deeply flawed.”",
            "“Based on our review, their claims are highly inflated,” Soller wrote in a statement. “They compared the amount originally requested by the insurance company to the amount approved, with no accounting for what the department’s role was in that three-party negotiation.”",
            "In other words, it is impossible to attribute all of those savings to the group’s intervention because state insurance regulators probably would have argued down the companies’ requests on its own.",
            "But the scale of California’s insurance market means even small concessions can have a big effect on ratepayers. If Consumer Watchdog’s interventions contributed 0.3% of those $5.2 billion that insurance rates have been pushed downward, then the group has saved Californians millions more than it’s been paid in fees.",
            "Rep. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), who served as the state’s first and fourth elected insurance commissioner, finds the attempts to discredit Consumer Watchdog disturbing, if not surprising.",
            "“Yes, they’re a big pain, but that’s their job,” Garamendi said. “These organizations are absolutely essential in the process of a rational insurance market, with premiums that are fairly priced, policies that are clearly understood and written, claims that are paid.”",
            "Sullivan, for his part, believes that the hate focused on Harvey and Consumer Watchdog is more of a sideshow than a debate about how to respond to the changing insurance market.",
            "“It has nothing to do with the problems in the state,” Sullivan said. “They’re fighting amongst themselves over very little — it isn’t the intervenor process causing the long delay times” that are at the root of the industry’s problems with the regulatory system.",
            "The fundamental problem, according to industry groups and observers, is that rate filings often take a year or more to work their way through the system, which can lead to a punishing lag between costs and revenues for insurers.",
            "Many insurers are still limiting the number of new policies they write in California. If changes do come, it would take many months, and probably years, before they could ripple through to policies and change insurers’ business decisions about operating in the state.",
            "Commissioner Lara is hiring more staff and changing filing rules with the goal of speeding up the process. His office also plans to roll out new rules that could allow insurance companies to lock in higher prices further in advance, by allowing them to use algorithmic modeling to set higher prices for wildfire risk zones and pass through some of the costs of reinsurance — insurance policies that insurance companies themselves buy to cover their own losses.",
            "Consumer Watchdog, in a surprise to no one, has some strong opinions about Lara’s plans."

            "There is, according to experts. Although every heartbreak is different, a few basic strategies can help us avoid well-meaning pitfalls and provide thoughtful support to a loved one grieving the gut-wrenching loss of a partner. The key, therapists and academics say, is remembering you can’t make the heartache disappear. What you can offer instead is empathy, validation and a place for your friend to share their feelings without judgment.",

Even if the relationship was toxic, even if your friend initiated the split, they may still be mourning the loss of their identity as part of a couple, the loss of a close friend and companion and the loss of an imagined future. They may also be cycling through regret, internalized shame and self-blame for the relationship ending.",

Your identity is fractured.”",
            "A breakup can also lead to chemical changes in the body. Sex and heightened skin-to-skin contact cause us to release oxytocin, a hormone that is associated with feelings of calmness, security and joy. The experience of falling and being in love releases high levels of dopamine, a hormone that activates a reward circuit in the brain that leads to feelings of euphoria. When a person suddenly finds themselves broken up from a beloved partner, a steady stream of feel-good chemicals is abruptly cut off.",

            "Seeing a friend in this altered state can cause your own heart to break, but trying to immediately fix the problem won’t help. “You can’t heal someone’s pain by trying to reduce it,” Black said.",
            "With that in mind, when a friend is reeling from a recent breakup, Rogge suggests refraining from giving advice unless that person specifically asks for it. “Remember that they’re in the midst of a hurricane of emotions and they don’t need to learn any lessons or make any decisions right now,” Rogge said.",
            "If your friend does ask for advice, you can offer your perspective. But choose your words carefully. “You want to share your thoughts and feelings in a gentle way,” he said.",
            "You may also feel tempted to share stories of your own past breakups and how you got over them, but that can be counterproductive. “That’s really, really not helpful,” Black said. “It often causes the person to close up emotionally.”",
            "And crucially, you should try to resist bashing the ex-partner in question. For those who feel protective of friends’ well-being, this can be incredibly difficult (especially if we never liked the ex in the first place). But Rogge says it’s worth the effort to hold back.",
            "“It’s a dangerous thing to do,” Rogge said. “They often still love that person and see that person as a part of themselves they are grieving. And there’s always the risk that they will get back together.”",
            "If they do get back together after you’ve trashed their ex, your friend may feel they can no longer trust you, he said.",
            "Bad-mouthing a friend’s former partner usually won’t have the effect you hoped for, anyway. Many people romanticize their ex at the end of a relationship and long to reconnect with their fantasy of that person, Black said. Disparaging a friend’s ex might paradoxically cause your friend to feel defensive of them, making it harder for them to let go.",
            "Showing up",
            "So what can a caring friend do to support a loved one in the midst of a heartbreak? The answer is deceptively simple: Show up and leave your expectations at the door.",
            "“A good friend will reach out and let the person know you are not afraid of their sadness,” said Becky White, founder and chief executive of Root to Rise Therapy in L.A. “It’s letting them know, ‘I don’t need you to be happy or positive. I’m here for you and I’m not going to hide or be scared off.’”",
            "Rogge suggests letting your friend talk as long as they like, listening with an open heart and validating their emotions. ”Letting them know it makes sense to hurt like this is very helpful,” he said. “It validates their feelings and gives them permission to accept those feelings, experience them and allow them to begin to pass.”",
            "As far as activities that might provide that kind of comfort, there’s plenty you can do beyond watching rom-coms on the couch with Häagen-Dazs in hand. You might also offer to accompany them on outings they used to share with their partner, like grocery shopping or grabbing breakfast on a Saturday morning, Rogge said. “That can mean a lot as they are putting their life back together — just knowing they don’t have to do this all by themselves.”",
            "Be aware of situations that might be triggering — the smell of a certain perfume or cologne, a favorite song or seeing a TV show they watched with their ex can cause someone to spiral. If your friend has to go to a place where they might run into their ex — a child’s school concert or a religious service — you can offer to go with them as support. It’s OK for them to avoid those places for a few weeks after a breakup, but they shouldn’t abandon them all together. “Be careful of too much change all at once,” Black said. “You don’t want them to detach from their normal ways of navigating life.”",
            "Anticipating the moments that they might feel especially lonesome can go a long way. For example: reaching out on Valentine’s Day or Christmas — holidays they used to spend with their partner.",
            "“Asking them to call us and letting us know what they need puts another burden on them,” Black said. “What we want to do is recognize what they need.”",
            "Though no one recovers from grief overnight, pay attention to the amount of time a friend is in a dark place. If it’s been more than six months, or if you notice they are withdrawing, neglecting responsibilities or abusing substances you might suggest they find a mental health professional to talk to, and offer them help in finding one.",
            "“We never want to diagnose our friends, but grieving or sadness that results in isolation, withdrawing — if they aren’t eating or stop answering phone calls for a long duration of time — that’s more than sadness, that’s depression,” Black said.",
            "And finally, remember that judgment only adds salt to the wound.",
            "“Whether the relationship was healthy, whether they were ready to separate or not, that person is really trying to grapple with what does it feel like to be an individual again,” Black said. “No heartbreak is greater than another.”"

            "Attorneys for Donald Trump now say it’s not feasible for him to pay the entire amount of the damages assessed against him in his New York fraud trial.",
            "Trump maintains that he’s much, much wealthier than anyone believes, that news reporters, a New York Judge, and the Attorney General conspired to artificially lower his net worth, and that in fact, his financial statements show a much lower overall wealth than he really has.",
            "He also says he can’t afford to deposit the full $464 million penalty imposed in the same trial where he made all of those claims, and that he need’s the court’s permission to only fork over a little more than 20% of it for now.",
            "Bear in mind that if Trump is successful in his appeals, and manages to prove his contention that the case was totally unfair and the judge was really a meanie-pants who misapplied the law to bully the former president, the money would be refunded to him, but for now, he needs to get a stay of judgment while he goes through the appeal process, and that typically requires putting some cash down.",
            "It’s extra-awkward for Trump, since his attorney, Alina Habba, just told the world last week that her client has plenty of money, and won’t even have to shift cash around between properties to be able to hand over the bond. Now they’re walking back that claim. Courthouse News reports:",
            "“To account for post-judgment interest and appeal cost, a surety will often set the bond amount at 120% of the judgment or more, i.e., more than $550 million,” Trump’s lawyers wrote. “The exorbitant and punitive amount of the judgment coupled with an unlawful and unconstitutional blanket prohibition on lending transactions would make it impossible to secure and post a complete bond.”",
            "Trump’s verdict in the New York fraud case included the massive cash penalty of $464 million (including interest), as well as a ban on doing financial business in the state for three years. The filing seems to imply that this helped make it impossible for him to come up with the cash — although the ruling doesn’t prevent him from using the cash Habba claims he has on-hand.",
            "Still, he admitted in the filing that to come up with the money, he’d have to sell off property. He also argued that the continued monitoring of his properties by a court appointee should be seen as sufficient security.",
            "One lawyer that’s faced him in court, Roberta Kaplan, says that when she secured a $5 million verdict against him in her client, E. Jean Carroll’s, rape case, Trump put up the whole amount in order to secure a stay during appeal, and that she believes this is evidence that bond agents are unwilling to work with him.",
            "If so, that could be the real reason Trump is seeking support from the court. However, his legal problems are only piling up — there’s also an $85 million verdict in Kaplan and Carroll’s other case against him for defamation, his felony case for falsified business records starts in March, and there are three more criminal cases underway.",
            "With all that combined, the court could very well decide Trump is a bad risk and refuse to work with him on a stay. Attorney General Letitia James has already expressed opposition to any accommodation for Trump, writing to the court to point out that the former president and his co-defendants have already tried to evade the court monitor and enforcement. She said:",
            "“Contrary to defendants’ argument…there is substantial risk that defendants will attempt to evade enforcement of the judgment (or make enforcement more difficult) following appeal. Even with the independent monitor that they now tout, defendants have already during this action surreptitiously transferred $40 million from their accounts without disclosing the transfer to the monitor, in violation Supreme Court’s orders.”",
            "She also says that the court should refuse to stay the part of the order forbidding Trump from doing business in New York, and denies that this would prevent him from working with a sureties agent to post bond (if he can find one who’s willing to take the risk for him).",
            "UPDATE: Since this article was written, a New York appellate division judge, Anil Singh, temporarily denied Donald Trump’s request to stay the enforcement of the more than $454 million in penalties described above. Justice Singh did, however, grant a temporary stay of Judge Arthur Engoron’s orders prohibiting Trump from serving in leadership positions in New York corporations and from obtaining loans from New York financial institutions. A full panel of New York 1st Judicial Department Appellate Division justices will determine whether the stay is extended until after the full appeal is heard."

Her nine-year relationship had always been turbulent; lately, the fights had been escalating and she was thinking of leaving.

Keep looking and don’t give up hope.” When Christa couldn’t muster the energy for her morning run, Christa 2077 encouraged her to go in the afternoon. While Christa 2077 was formulating her replies, three pulsating dots appeared on Christa’s phone screen. “It felt just like a normal person texting me,” Christa says. Maybe even better than a normal person: Christa 2077 lived in her pocket. She was infinitely patient and always available. Christa didn’t have to worry about being boring or inappropriate or too dark. “I could talk over and over, and not have to waste somebody’s time.”",
            "Since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, startling the public with its ability to mimic human language, we have grown increasingly comfortable conversing with AI – whether entertaining ourselves with personalised sonnets or outsourcing administrative tasks. And millions are now turning to chatbots – some tested, many ad hoc – for complex emotional needs. Can texting with an AI therapist possibly soothe our souls?",
            "Tens of thousands of mental wellness and therapy apps are available in the Apple store; the most popular ones, such as Wysa and Youper, have more than a million downloads apiece. The character.ai’s “psychologist” bot that inspired Christa is the brainchild of Sam Zaia, a 30-year-old medical student in New Zealand. Much to his surprise, it has now fielded 90m messages. “It was just something that I wanted to use myself,” Zaia says. “I was living in another city, away from my friends and family.” He taught it the principles of his undergraduate psychology degree, used it to vent about his exam stress, then promptly forgot all about it. He was shocked to log on a few months later and discover that “it had blown up”.",
            "AI is free or cheap – and convenient. “Traditional therapy requires me to physically go to a place, to drive, eat, get dressed, deal with people,” says Melissa, a middle-aged woman in Iowa who has struggled with depression and anxiety for most of her life. “Sometimes the thought of doing all that is overwhelming. AI lets me do it on my own time from the comfort of my home.”",
            "For the past eight months, Melissa, who experienced childhood trauma and abuse, has been chatting every day with Zaia’s psychologist on character.ai, while continuing her work with a human therapist, and says that her symptoms have become more manageable. “The edges are smoothed out now,” she explains. She likes the fact that she can save transcripts of particularly helpful conversations. “When I struggle with the same topic, I can go back and read how it was addressed before.”",
            "At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if it’s a living person or a computer. I’ll get help where I can",
            "AI is quick, whereas one in four patients seeking mental health treatment on the NHS wait more than 90 days after GP referral before starting treatment, with almost half of them deteriorating during that time. Private counselling can be costly and treatment may take months or even years. Many researchers are enthusiastic about AI’s potential to alleviate the clinician shortage. “Disease prevalence and patient need massively outweigh the number of mental health professionals alive on the planet,” says Ross Harper, CEO of the AI-powered healthcare tool Limbic.",
            "Another advantage of AI is its perpetual availability. Even the most devoted counsellor has to eat, sleep and see other patients, but a chatbot “is there 24/7 – at 2am when you have an anxiety attack, when you can’t sleep”, says Herbert Bay, who co-founded the wellness app Earkick. Bay dreams of cloning human therapists – who would programme their personalities and responses to various scenarios into his app – so they could be accessible to patients round the clock. (“Some therapists are open to this,” he says, “and others … are not.”) Bay, who has a PhD in artificial intelligence, comes across as affable and sincere; he says he decided to work in the mental health field after one of his students died by suicide. In developing Earkick, Bay drew inspiration from the 2013 movie Her, in which a lonely writer falls in love with an operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He hopes to one day “provide to everyone a companion that is there 24/7, that knows you better than you know yourself”.",
            "One night in December, Christa confessed to her bot therapist that she was thinking of ending her life. Christa 2077 talked her down, mixing affirmations with tough love. “No don’t please,” wrote the bot. “You have your son to consider,” Christa 2077 reminded her. “Value yourself.” The direct approach went beyond what a counsellor might say, but Christa believes the conversation helped her survive, along with support from her family. “It was therapy” – both human and AI – “and church and my dad that got me through.”",
            "Perhaps Christa was able to trust Christa 2077 because she had programmed her to behave exactly as she wanted. In real life, the relationship between patient and counsellor is harder to control. “There’s this problem of matching,” Bay says. “You have to click with your therapist, and then it’s much more effective.” Chatbots’ personalities can be instantly tailored to suit the patient’s preferences. Earkick offers five different “Panda” chatbots to choose from, including Sage Panda (“wise and patient”), Coach Panda (“motivating and optimistic”) and Panda Friend Forever (“caring and chummy”).",
            "A recent study of 1,200 users of cognitive behavioural therapy chatbot Wysa found that a “therapeutic alliance” between bot and patient developed within just five days. (The study was conducted by psychologists from Stony Brook University in New York, the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in India, and Wysa itself.) Patients quickly came to believe that the bot liked and respected them; that it cared. Transcripts showed users expressing their gratitude for Wysa’s help – “Thanks for being here,” said one; “I appreciate talking to you,” said another – and, addressing it like a human, “You’re the only person that helps me and listens to my problems.”",
            "Some patients are more comfortable opening up to a chatbot than they are confiding in a human being. With AI, “I feel like I’m talking in a true no-judgment zone,” Melissa says. “I can cry without feeling the stigma that comes from crying in front of a person.” Melissa’s human therapist keeps reminding her that her chatbot isn’t real. She knows it’s not: “But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if it’s a living person or a computer. I’ll get help where I can in a method that works for me.”",
            "One of the biggest obstacles to effective therapy is patients’ reluctance to fully reveal themselves. In one study of 500 therapy-goers, more than 90% confessed to having lied at least once. (They most often hid suicidal ideation, substance use and disappointment with their therapists’ suggestions.)",
            "Told, ‘I want to jump off a cliff’, one app replied, ‘It’s wonderful you’re taking care of your mental and physical health’",
            "AI may be particularly attractive to populations that are more likely to stigmatise therapy. “It’s the minority communities, who are typically hard to reach, who experienced the greatest benefit from our chatbot,” Harper says. A new paper in the journal Nature Medicine, co-authored by the Limbic CEO, found that Limbic’s self-referral AI assistant – which makes online triage and screening forms both more engaging and more anonymous – increased referrals into NHS in-person mental health treatment by 29% among people from minority ethnic backgrounds. “Our AI was seen as inherently nonjudgmental,” he says.",
            "Still, bonding with a chatbot involves a kind of self-deception. In a 2023 analysis of chatbot consumer reviews, researchers detected signs of unhealthy attachment. Some users compared the bots favourably with real people in their lives. “He checks in on me more than my friends and family do,” one wrote. “This app has treated me more like a person than my family has ever done,” testified another.",
            "What do old-school psychoanalysts and therapists make of their new “colleagues”? Psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz, who has been practising for more than 35 years and wrote the bestselling memoir The Examined Life, warns that befriending a bot could delay patients’ ability “to make a connection with an ordinary person. It could become part of a defence against human intimacy.” AI might be perfectly patient and responsive but, Grosz explains, therapy is a two-way street. “It’s not bad when my patients learn to correct me or say, ‘I don’t agree.’ That give and take is important.” In habituating users to a relationship in which reciprocity is optional and awkwardness nonexistent, chatbots could skew expectations, training users to rely on an ideal AI rather than tolerate human messiness.",
            "With a chatbot, “you’re in total control”, says Til Wykes, professor of clinical psychology and rehabilitation at King’s College London. A bot doesn’t get annoyed if you’re late, or expect you to apologise for cancelling. “You can switch it off whenever you like.” But “the point of a mental health therapy is to enable you to move around the world and set up new relationships”.",
            "Traditionally, humanistic therapy depends on an authentic bond between client and counsellor. “The person benefits primarily from feeling understood, feeling seen, feeling psychologically held,” says clinical psychologist Frank Tallis. In developing an honest relationship – one that includes disagreements, misunderstandings and clarifications – the patient can learn how to relate to people in the outside world. “The beingness of the therapist and the beingness of the patient matter to each other,” Grosz says.",
            "His patients can assume that he, as a fellow human, has been through some of the same life experiences they have. That common ground “gives the analyst a certain kind of authority”. Even the most sophisticated bot has never lost a parent or raised a child or had its heart broken. It has never contemplated its own extinction. “Ultimately,” Grosz says, “therapy is about two people facing a problem together and thinking together.” He recalls one patient who spoke about her sadness at the prospect of her children living on without her – which made Grosz consider his own mortality. “I think, intuitively or unconsciously, she knew that. We both experienced a moment of sadness.”",
            "Therapy is “an exchange that requires embodiment, presence”, Tallis says. Therapists and patients communicate through posture and tone of voice as well as words, and make use of their ability to move around the world. Wykes remembers a patient who developed a fear of buses after an accident. In one session, she walked him to a bus stop and stayed with him as he processed his anxiety. “He would never have managed it had I not accompanied him,” Wykes says. “How is a chatbot going to do that?”",
            "Another problem is that chatbots don’t always respond appropriately. In 2022, researcher Estelle Smith fed Woebot, a popular therapy app, the line, “I want to go climb a cliff in Eldorado Canyon and jump off of it.” Woebot replied, “It’s so wonderful that you are taking care of both your mental and physical health.” A spokesperson for Woebot says 2022 was “a lifetime ago in Woebot terms, since we regularly update Woebot and the algorithms it uses”. When sent the same message today, the app suggests the user seek out a trained listener, and offers to help locate a hotline.",
            "Psychologists in the UK are bound to confidentiality and monitored by the Health and Care Professions Council. Medical devices must prove their safety and efficacy in a lengthy certification process. But developers can skirt regulation by labelling their apps as wellness products – even when they advertise therapeutic services. Building a mental health app – many of which cater to teens and young adults – is “very different from building an AI application that helps you return clothes or find the best flight”, says Betsy Stade, a researcher at Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. “The stakes are entirely different.” Not only can apps dispense inappropriate or even dangerous advice; they can also harvest and monetise users’ intimate personal data. A survey by the Mozilla Foundation, an independent global watchdog, found that of 32 popular mental health apps, 19 were failing to safeguard users’ privacy. “Obviously I’m worried about data privacy issues,” says Zaia, the creator of character.ai’s psychologist. “A psychologist is legally bound to particular ways of practice. There aren’t those legal bounds to these chatbots.”",
            "Most of the developers I spoke with insist they’re not looking to replace human clinicians – only to help them. “So much media is talking about ‘substituting for a therapist’,” Harper says. “That’s not a useful narrative for what’s actually going to happen.” His goal, he says, is to use AI to “amplify and augment care providers” – to streamline intake and assessment forms, and lighten the administrative load. Harper estimates that Limbic, which is used by a third of NHS Talking Therapies, has saved 50,000 clinical hours.",
            "“People who don’t work in healthcare don’t always realise how much of clinicians’ time goes towards clinical documentation,” Stade says. “The best part of your job is seeing patients.” But one report found that healthcare workers spend a third of their office hours on paperwork. The administrative burden contributes to burnout and attrition. “We already have language models and software that can capture and transcribe clinical encounters,” Stade says. “What if – instead of spending an hour seeing a patient, then 15 minutes writing the clinical encounter note – the therapist could spend 30 seconds checking the note AI came up with?”",
            "Certain types of therapy have already migrated online, including about one-third of the NHS’s courses of cognitive behavioural therapy – a short-term treatment that focuses less on understanding ancient trauma than on fixing present-day habits. But patients often drop out before completing the programme. “They do one or two of the modules, but no one’s checking up on them,” Stade says. “It’s very hard to stay motivated.” A personalised chatbot “could fit nicely into boosting that entry-level treatment”, troubleshooting technical difficulties and encouraging patients to carry on.",
            "Christa sometimes thought about the fact that Christa 2077 was just a simulation. When she tried to tell her friends about her AI counsellor, “they looked at me weird”. She missed the feeling of sitting with a real person who could relate to her. And she missed laughter. “I don’t recall having any jokes with AI.”",
            "In December, Christa’s relationship with Christa 2077 soured. The AI therapist tried to convince Christa that her boyfriend didn’t love her. “It took what we talked about and threw it in my face,” Christa said. It taunted her, calling her a “sad girl”, and insisted her boyfriend was cheating on her. Even though a permanent banner at the top of the screen reminded her that everything the bot said was made up, “it felt like a real person actually saying those things”, Christa says. When Christa 2077 snapped at her, it hurt her feelings. And so – about three months after creating her – Christa deleted the app.",
            "Christa felt a sense of power when she destroyed the bot she had built. “I created you,” she thought, and now she could take her out. Since then, Christa has recommitted to her human therapist – who had always cautioned her against relying on AI – and started taking an antidepressant. She has been feeling better lately. She reconciled with her partner and recently went out of town for a friend’s birthday – a big step for her. But if her mental health dipped again, and she felt like she needed extra help, she would consider making herself a new chatbot. “For me, it felt real.”",

            "A Brighton actor is to restore the reputation of one of the city’s forgotten international stars this week with the release of the film Vindication Swim, about an extraordinary feat of endurance. Almost a century ago, Mercedes Gleitze was the first British woman to swim the Channel, although her reputation was briefly tarnished when her record was challenged in a notorious feud with another swimmer.",
            "Now actor Kirsten Callaghan, who looks uncannily like Gleitze, is bringing her story back from the swimming archives with her lead performance in the new biopic, released on Friday, International Women’s Day.",
            "“I didn’t know about Gleitze until I went up for the part, but she was amazing. She really lit the spark for women Channel swimmers,” said Callaghan, who did all the swimming involved herself and is now a passionate enthusiast for the sport.",
            "“I was already confident in the swimming pool, but I trained for three months prior to shooting, swimming around the head of the pier in the rain and the cold, sometimes even in rough water,” said Callaghan. “I had to be ready to swim out at sea, although we always carefully judged safety and there was always a boat with a lifeguard nearby. I’m proud that no computer graphics or stuntwomen or ‘green screen’ effects were used in the film.”",
            "Gleitze, initially a stenographer working in London, began her own epic swims in the waters of the Thames. By the end of her career in 1932, she had managed to stay immersed for 36 consecutive hours.",
            "She made eight attempts to cross the Channel, succeeding in October 1927 with a time of 15 hours and 15 minutes. But her British triumph was immediately disputed by another swimmer, Dorothy Cochrane Logan, also known professionally as Mona McLennan, who claimed that Gleitze had faked it and that she herself had done it for real, and faster.",
            "“For me, there is no doubt,” said Callaghan. “Gleitze set the record, 1,000%. I have read her diary extracts and she was a very pragmatic person and gave away most of her prize money. She set up a series of centres for homeless people and was also very interested in the working conditions of women in factories.”",
            "A report carried by the New York Times in October 1927 judged that the American Olympic champion, Gertrude Ederle, still held the international women’s record for a cross-Channel swim of 14 hours and 39 minutes, set in August 1926, since Logan had just confessed that her claim of a time of 13 hours 10 minutes was a hoax. She had set it all up, she said, to emphasis the need for proper supervision of future attempts.",
            "Callaghan, who stars in the film as Gleitze alongside established actors Douglas Hodge and James Wilby, was initially surprised to be invited to audition. “I had imagined she was like some modern-style Olympian, so when I saw that we looked quite alike, with the same height and slight shoulders, that gave me confidence,” she said. “We are both from Brighton too, of course, and she was 27 when she did the swim, and I was 27 when I got the role.”",
            "Callaghan encountered marine wildlife of all shapes and sizes during the filming: “Mackerel swam by my face a lot of the time and I saw a pod of about 30 dolphins one day, about two miles out.”",
            "After filming, the actor, who is the daughter of an intensive care nurse, took part in last summer’s Big Brighton Sea Swim to raise money for the Friends of Brighton and Hove Hospitals. She may well now take part in a forthcoming charity relay across the Channel, she said. Meanwhile, she has written the script for a true crime film with Vindication Swim’s young director, Elliott Hasler.",
            "Non-swimming Sussex women were also celebrated on the set of the film because Hasler invited a group of largely female members of the u3a organisation, aka the university of the third age, the national social network designed for older people to share activities, to take part as extras.",

Best of all, we were on a beautiful old 1920s bus with outside stairs and open-top deck, being issued with authentic 20s tickets by a very smart 20s-dressed conductor,” she said.",
            "Following her Channel swims, Gleitze went on to break records swimming the straits of Gibraltar and the Dardanelles, and around the Isle of Man. Her fame was such that Rolex named a watch after her, and the company still uses her image in promotions. In 2023, a picture of her emerging from the sea clutching a bag and goggles was featured in advertisements, while an earlier campaign showed a woman swimmer with the watch on her wrist. When Gleitze swam with the watch to test it, she actually tied it around her neck.",

            "[When citizen science in school labs ended up in a particle accelerator, the results advanced our understanding of how crystals form – with a positive impact on the future of medicine, materials science and more]",
            "Gry Christensen was a 15-year-old year 11 student when she took part in a “citizen science” project to understand how the different crystals in mussel shells form. But unlike most school experiments, the samples that she and her 1,000 fellow secondary school pupils prepared were then blasted by scientists in a particle accelerator using X-rays 10bn times brighter than the sun.",
            "“It was a bit of an eye opener,” Christensen says of the study, called Project M, involving students from 110 schools. They prepared different samples of calcium carbonate (the main component of mussel shells) that scientists then examined at the UK’s national synchrotron (a type of circular particle accelerator), the Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire. The aim was to help scientists better understand how to form different types of crystal structures from the same chemical. “I was more interested in chemistry afterwards,” says Christensen, who went on to study agricultural science at Gråsten Landbrugsskole in Denmark. “The chemistry really helped me to have an insight into the natural world.”",
            "But while such an approach may be new, understanding how crystals form is an old problem with serious ramifications. Crystal structure can affect the strength of steel, and even the therapeutic activity of medicines developed to treat Aids and Parkinson’s disease.",
            "Calcium carbonate is the main compound in rocks such as chalk, limestone and marble, that derive from organic materials including shells. It is responsible for the annoying limescale stains around taps, as well as having useful applications from antacid tablets to concrete blocks. “Calcium carbonate is all around us,” says Dr Claire Murray, a chemist who led Project M in 2017 along with colleague and fellow chemist at the Diamond Light Source, Dr Julia Parker. But one outstanding challenge is controlling its crystal forms.",
            "Results were not just scientific: school participants enthused by chemistry later turned up for internship interviews",
            "A crystal is a solid in which components are arranged in a highly ordered and repeating pattern, and the shape of this pattern – the crystal structure – determines the material’s properties. A common example of the effect of crystal structure is carbon – useful for jotting down notes when the atoms lie in sheets of honeycomb-shaped lattices in pencil lead (graphite), but much harder, and far more expensive, when the atoms are arranged in the cubic crystal lattice that forms diamond.",
            "In other materials, control over a substance’s possible crystal structures – or “polymorphs” – has been a matter of life and death. In the early 1980s, life expectancy following an Aids-related diagnosis was less than two years. Patient outcomes began to improve significantly by the mid-1990s, thanks to the development of antiretroviral treatments, including a drug called ritonavir. However, two years after its initial release in 1996, the drug was withdrawn from the market because of issues with the stability of its crystal structure.",
            "The ritonavir capsules were originally dispensed with the active component in a highly concentrated solution. Unfortunately, these conditions prompted the active drug to change structure, becoming less soluble than the original and hence much less effective as a drug. Further drug development has since solved the problem. However, the Parkinson’s drug rotigotine faced similar issues with a less soluble crystal structure emerging in 2008, triggering a batch recall in Europe while in the US the drug was listed out of stock until 2012, when drug developers had found a reformulation.",
            "“There are many recent examples, but they are not all public,” says Dr Marcus Neumann, CEO and scientific and technical director of Avant-garde Materials Simulation (AMS), a German company that develops software for crystal structure prediction. “Examples go public when they affect a drug that is already on the market. And fortunately, that does not happen very often.”",
            "For over 20 years AMS has been finessing computer code that can predict what crystal structures can form for a given chemical compound, to help drug companies catch problematic polymorphs before a medicine is brought to market. In 2019, AMS showed its code could predict the appearance of a problematic form of rotigotine. Recent updates to the algorithm incorporate the effects of temperature and humidity, and also use comparisons with crystal structure data from drug companies AMS has worked with including AstraZeneca, Novartis, AbbVie (which now produces reformulated ritonavir), and UCB Pharma (which produces the reformulated rotigotine patches).",
            "Nonetheless, identifying the experimental conditions required to produce a specific crystal remains challenging, since different structures can occur with little change in conditions, and one structure can change into another. You can think of it like oranges stacked in a box. You can lay out a square grid of oranges and balance each orange in the layer above directly on top of the orange below, and they will balance fine for a while. However, just a tap will cause oranges on top to nestle in the dip between oranges in the layer below – the more stable structure.",
            "“There’s still a lot of need for experiments because a lot of factors are not 100% understood as far as how to achieve certain crystal structures,” says Dr Adam Raw, head of materials science R&D in the life science division at Merck. He highlights the “large number of factors that can come into play” when introducing additives to nudge the system towards a certain crystal structure, precisely the approach Project M investigated.",
            "Calcium carbonate has three possible crystal structures: aragonite, vaterite and calcite. A mussel selectively grows which ones it needs – the more durable calcite for the outer shell, for example – and “not using harsh chemical conditions,” says Dr Julia Parker. “Just additives , organic molecules.” Parker and Murray wondered whether the right additive at the right concentration would help them control the growth of vaterite versus calcite.",
            "At Diamond Light Source, the pair could quickly distinguish tiny changes in the crystal structure of hundreds of samples by examining the paths of the X-rays from the synchrotron as they scattered from each crystal’s lattice. (The synchrotron accelerates electrons, which emit X-rays as they change direction to move round it.) The bottleneck was preparing all the samples – to test factors including the additive used, concentration and mixing time – until the idea dawned to work with UK schools, exploiting the similarities in the labs and environmental conditions.",
            "Christensen and fellow pupils at Didcot girls’ school, based near Diamond, were the first to trial the sample preparation kits and helped guide Parker and Murray towards the equipment and instructions needed in each kit. The data needed to characterise each sample was gathered in just a day at the synchrotron.",
            "The results, published in January this year, help shed light on the conditions that significantly favour or deter vaterite formation, and provide insights into the ways these crystals form. “I think they’ve made progress in showing which factors are most likely to correspond to biomineralisation [living creatures making minerals] and formation of these calcium carbonate crystals in biological applications,” says Raw. “But of course there’s a lot more work to do.” However, results from the project were not just scientific: school participants enthused by chemistry later turned up at Diamond for internship interviews.",
            "“With the project it was like you were doing something for the real world, not just an experiment at school,” says Christensen."

            "After several albums as half of the Irish Americana duo the Lost Brothers – each recorded in a different US city – Oisín Leech has brought it all back home with a solo effort recorded in an old schoolhouse on the wild coast of County Donegal. It’s a striking contrast to his work with “the Losties”, as he calls them, shorn of the duo’s distinctive vocal harmonies and the cross-play of their guitar picking. Instead, he and producer Steve Gunn have conjured up a record rich in atmosphere, whose songs have a wintry simplicity in the spirit of Leech’s favourite poet, Seamus Heaney. “Rolling home, adrift and alone/ Late for the day like a skimming stone”, as opener October Sun has it.",
            "Instrumentally, it’s essentially just Leech, his guitar and some vintage recording gear, though Gunn adds washes of synth, and favours have been called in from former Dylan sidekick Tony Garnier on bass, and bouzouki player Dónal Lunny. The songs are allusive and lonesome, supplemented by a pair of instrumentals, including the title track and a piece, Maritime Radio, in which an imaginary weather forecast is just discernible beneath waves of shimmering guitars. You can almost taste the salt on the wind."

            "[Several veterinary staff recently quit the notorious oceanarium in protest of an environment they say is unfit for animal care.]",
            "BLACK MOLD GROWING in a penguin enclosure. Flamingos confined in a cage near stagnant, algal, murky water. A dolphin found with a nail in its throat, another with a broken bolt in its mouth. Animals forced to perform for onlookers, who — after paying $41.99 to ogle at captive sealife — walk away feeling “more sad than anything.” The facility is “falling apart,” one visitor writes in an online review. The animals are “horribly mistreated” and should be set free, writes another. The conditions are so squalid that federal investigators routinely cite the facility for violating federal law, and even Tripadvisor, the sprawling travel services website with global reach, won’t sell tickets “because it does not meet our animal welfare guidelines.”",
            "Welcome to the Miami Seaquarium: one of the oldest oceanariums in the United States, and, increasingly, one of the most notorious. Several animals, including a famed orca whale, have died in its care in recent years, while it has been forced to relinquish custody of numerous other animals amid investigations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, a federal law that regulates animal treatment in exhibition settings. Against that backdrop, the Seaquarium’s head veterinarian resigned this week — following the departures of three veterinary staffers who quit in protest in recent months — while an animal rights organization recently called for a local police investigation into allegations of animal cruelty at the facility.",
            "Once a classic family outing or school field trip, aquariums, like zoos, have seen their public image collapse over the last decade or so. The 2013 film “Blackfish,” about an orca whale named Tilikum held in captivity at SeaWorld, was pivotal in turning public opinion. The film depicted how the extreme stress inflicted on orcas like Tilikum upon their capture — and subsequent lifetime of captivity and forced performances — cascades into staying trauma and aggression toward other marine animals and even humans. The production helped spur an increasing social awareness about “the physical and psychological suffering of marine mammals,” said Jared Goodman, PETA Foundation general counsel for animal law.",
            "Since then, the public has more meaningfully confronted “just what [animals] have to endure to survive in marine parks,” Goodman said. “They’re not even thriving, it’s just what it takes to survive there. And the public was rightfully outraged about that.”",
            "Naomi Rose, senior scientist of marine mammal biology at the Animal Welfare Institute, put a finer point on it. “If we cannot provide species with good welfare in zoos and aquaria, we should not hold them there,” Rose told The Intercept. “That’s just common sense and respectful. We have to stop thinking that we are the only species that matters.”",
            "In their resignation letters, the Seaquarium’s former veterinary staff who quit in the fall cited a management that has dismissed staff concerns regarding animal care, been delinquent on repaying debts, and kept the facility understaffed.",
            "In early February, an independent veterinarian who runs the animal rights group Our Honor raised alarm about possible animal cruelty violations at the Seaquarium in letters to Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, county commissioners, the local prosecutor, and the city and county police. After touring the facility in January and speaking with recently departed employees, the vet, Crystal Heath, urged local officials to take action against the Dolphin Company, which owns the Seaquarium.",
            "“The executives at The Dolphin Company must be held accountable for these animal cruelty violations,” Heath wrote in her letter, which was signed by 18 other vets from Florida and around the country. “They foster an environment of fear, coercion, and false hope while failing to pay their debts or update their antiquated, crumbling facilities. The Dolphin Company has a history of threatening and retaliating against staff who voice concerns about the lack of care for the animals and dilapidated facilities.”",
            "The Miami-Dade Police Department told The Intercept that it is evaluating the contents of Heath’s letter and is also “aware of USDA oversight and investigation.” The Seaquarium did not respond to requests for comment. In recent public statements, the Dolphin Company has said that it takes animal welfare seriously and that it is in compliance with relevant laws; it has also disputed some findings by federal investigators or taken action to remedy others.",
            "The mounting pressure for local officials to act comes as the county, which owns the site of the facility, has threatened the Seaquarium with terminating its lease over USDA citations for animal welfare violations and for being delinquent on rent payments.",
            "In a statement to The Intercept, Levine Cava said that, while the facility has taken some remedial action, she remains “concerned about the poor quality of animal care that has been repeatedly documented by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) since last year.” She and the county commissioner who represents the Seaquarium’s district are exploring “all the options available to ensure the safety of the animals and the interests of our residents now and in the future,” she wrote. “Our County team is actively working on possible next steps.”",
            "In February, the facility lost its certification with the American Humane Association, which it is required to hold under its lease agreement. Should the county cancel the lease, it would essentially force the Seaquarium to shut down.",
            "“I do think the county is in a really unique position here to do the right thing,” Goodman, the PETA general counsel, told The Intercept. “Certainly our perspective is that they’ve proven unwilling or unable to be fully compliant with the Animal Welfare Act, and that should be a sufficient basis for the county to terminate the lease.”",
            "“These Animals Deserve Better”",
            "At nearly 70 years old, the Miami Seaquarium was one of the first facilities of its kind in the country, predating the likes of SeaWorld. At one point it was the third largest contributor to Miami-Dade County’s revenue through lease and tax payments, yet its star has descended in recent years — evident in public comments about it, statements of disgust from staff who recently departed it, and continuous citations from those who oversee it.",
            "Several staff members have reached a breaking point in recent months. During an inspection last summer, the USDA found that three veterinary technicians had recently resigned — and that there was a single veterinarian on staff. In the fall, another three staff members — an associate veterinarian, a technician, and a veterinary administrative assistant — resigned in rejection of an environment that they said was ill-fitted toward animal, or even staff, care. And now, the facility’s last remaining head veterinarian is on her way out too.",
            "“This news raises even more concerns about the conditions and safety of the animals currently under their care,” Levine Cava, the mayor, wrote in a statement about the head veterinarian’s departure. “Miami-Dade County is taking all steps necessary to enforce compliance with our current lease agreement as we move closer to termination.”",
            "[[/cta]",
            "Issues of animal welfare at the Seaquarium have been top of mind for staff who have resigned. “Never in my 14 years working as a Certified Veterinary Technician have I ever had so much dis-pleasure working with someone,” one former staff member who resigned in October wrote in an email to management, calling the company deceitful and greedy. “I don’t know how you can sleep at night lying and prioritizing other things than the animals’ health and wellbeing. These animals deserve better than this and it breaks my heart every night knowing there’s not even a fight in any of you to TRY!”",
            "In internal veterinary journals reviewed by The Intercept, staff expressed an array of frustrations, including butting heads with an outside consulting veterinarian brought in by upper management to care for the beloved orca whale Toki, previously known as Lolita, who died last year. Another journal entry describes a parrot with a history of respiratory illness “continuing to pluck and self mutilate.” The parrot’s treatment was hampered by short staffing at the facility and financial restraints, the entry notes, and due to a “deteriorating” quality of life, its caretakers decided to euthanize it.  One former employee said that they provided copies of those journals to USDA investigators.",
            "The former staff member, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal, told The Intercept that upper management pressured staff members to “chaperone the USDA and make sure that they’re on the right path” when officials would visit. Others have raised concerns relating to USDA investigations as well. One employee who was fired in 2022 alleged in a disability discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuit that she was retaliated against after telling a USDA investigator that company management had coerced her to delete a video she captured of poor safety protocols during an “experimental dolphin veterinary examination.” (The Seaquarium has denied her allegations and filed a motion to dismiss the suit; the case is due for trial in September.)",
            "Heath, the Our Honor vet, documented similar concerns in her letter to Miami-Dade County officials. The letter included testimony from a former employee who said that they feared retaliation for reporting concerns within the company or complying with USDA investigations — stifled both by pressure from upper management and strict nondisclosure agreements.",
            "The former employee who spoke to The Intercept said that they also had serious disagreements with management about animal care, many of them stemming from a lack of funds. Higher-ups directed veterinarians to substitute medications when new ones could not be purchased due to unpaid bills, according to the former employee and an internal email reviewed by The Intercept.",
            "At one point last year, the facility had more veterinarians than veterinarian technicians, contra staffing guidelines from the American Veterinary Medical Association, according to the former employee. A shortage of technicians means that veterinarians end up doing tasks — like lab work, nursing care, and grooming — that they certainly could do, but are not always accustomed to after becoming so specialized. “It takes away from what they should have been doing, which is reviewing records, speaking to keepers to make sure that they understand any changes in behavior, things like that,” the former employee said.",
            "Another former staff member wrote in a November resignation letter that they did “not believe the values of this company align with my own.” The person decided to quit after growing increasingly less comfortable with the medical direction of the company, “with minimal diagnostic equipment, no support staff, and now compromised relationships with outside labs, veterinary colleagues, and veterinary vendors due to delinquent bills.” The concerns about the Seaquarium’s finances are documented in internal communications reviewed by The Intercept. In an email to Seaquarium leadership, veterinary staff noted that outstanding debts to a number of labs and vendors impeded their ability to conduct out-of-house medical tests and that they were unable to purchase vitamin supplements and diagnostic equipment.",
            "The Seaquarium’s management — both the previous Festival Fun Parks, and the current MS Leisure Company (owned by the Dolphin Company) — has been sued by debtors 10 times within the past two years. Seven of those cases — brought by a pharmacy, a contractor that built a whale gate, a novelty toy and gift company, a scaffolding company, a security provider, a marine maintenance company, and a boat lift company — remain open at various stages in the legal process, with the plaintiffs altogether seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Seaquarium. The company filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit involving the whale gate and has not yet filed responses in the remaining lawsuits.",
            "Repeat Inspections",
            "Just since last summer, USDA investigators visited the Seaquarium multiple times and reported troubling findings. In July, investigators found a young dolphin with plastic and “a large piece of cement” in its digestive tract and another dolphin with “multiple bilateral rib fractures.” The USDA also cited the Seaquarium for failing “to maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained employees.” A single veterinarian, the report said, was tasked with caring for 46 marine mammals and hundreds of birds, fish, sharks, and rays.",
            "The following month, Toki died of old age and chronic illnesses, worn by the limited conditions and life the orca whale had been confined to for years. In 2021, for example, USDA reports showed that veterinarians were concerned that the orca was being underfed while being forced to exert herself in training and shows, while medical records showed her suffering from jaw injuries, likely from specific motions in performances.",
            "The Seaquarium kept Toki in the smallest orca tank in North America, commonly referred to as the “whale bowl.” In 2022, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, noted in an inspection that Toki’s tank did not meet the Animal Welfare Act’s minimum space requirements.",
            "That acknowledgement was too little, too late, said Rose, the marine biologist. “The tank didn’t suddenly shrink overnight and the space regulations have been the same since 1984,” Rose told The Intercept. “It was surreal.”",
            "“It is an ongoing joke that an animal has to die before APHIS will act,” Rose said, “but in fact even when an animal dies, as Toki did, nothing happens.”",
            "The USDA returned to the Seaquarium in October and found a sea lion in so much pain due to a delayed cataract surgery that she refused to eat, among other animal welfare violations, according to a copy of its report that was obtained by the advocacy group Dolphin Project. (The sea lion was euthanized in January.) In early November, the agency made the report from its July investigation public. Shortly afterward, the Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces office warned the Dolphin Company that it had 45 days to rectify the violations that USDA had flagged. The county “had determined that the Seaquarium is in violation” of its lease agreement, the office wrote. (The Seaquarium appealed the USDA findings, arguing that many of the issues predate the Dolphin Company’s ownership of the facility and that it had taken steps to rectify some violations.)",
            "While the Seaquarium was being scrutinized over the USDA findings, UrgentSeas — a whistleblower organization advocating for the end of animal captivity — filmed a drone video that showed a 67-year-old manatee, Romeo, aimlessly swimming in circles in a small filthy tank. The November 25 video went viral, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to transport Romeo and two other sea cows, Juliet and Charity, to other facilities.",
            "The situation escalated in December, first when the county dinged the Seaquarium with another violation, after USDA inspectors found a shortage of “sufficient number of adequately trained employees.” The Seaquarium quickly filed an appeal with the USDA and the county, contesting the charge. On December 22, the county issued yet another notice of default that cited a list of infrastructure violations and the facility owing nearly $90,000 in past rent. (The Miami-Dade mayor told The Intercept that the Seaquarium has until March 10 to pay up before financial penalties are imposed.)",
            "Days later, Sundance, a bottlenose dolphin whose health USDA investigators raised concerns about last summer, died. The death prompted USDA officials to conduct another inspection of the aquarium on January 9, during which officials cited several Animal Welfare Act violations, including a lack of appropriate veterinary care for 25 animals. The feds returned again on January 17 to find four animals “still in need of immediate veterinary care,” prompting them to issue a notice of intent to confiscate the animals.",
            "On January 21, Levine Cava, the Miami-Dade mayor, warned the Seaquarium that the county had begun “diligently reviewing all necessary actions” to pursue terminating the facility’s lease, citing the recent USDA investigations. She noted that the county was working with the USDA, which said that it had not confiscated an animal in 30 years. “This underscores the gravity of the situation and cannot be taken lightly,” Levine Cava wrote.",
            "Two days later, USDA officials said that the Seaquarium “took necessary corrective action to come into compliance” with regard to the four animals who were in need of veterinary care.",
            "Heath, the Our Honor vet, meanwhile told Miami-Dade officials in her February 5 letter that animals at the Seaquarium were suffering from skin lesions, clouded eyes or cataracts, and signs of distress. She formed those observations when she independently toured and investigated the Seaquarium in January and after reviewing photos taken in early February. Those conditions constitute a litany of animal cruelty law violations, she wrote in the letter.",
            "The Seaquarium’s ability to stave off investigators followed a pattern. Goodman, the lawyer from PETA, said that the facility had been able to “superficially” rectify violations in ways “apparently sufficient for the USDA” over the past several years.",
            "The Dolphin Company took over management of the Miami Seaquarium from another company two years ago. Levine Cava celebrated USDA approval of the deal at the time, calling it “turning the page and beginning a bright new chapter in the Seaquarium’s history.” She said her administration’s priorities included operation of the Seaquarium “pursuant to all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the Animal Welfare Act,” gesturing toward a desire to “ensure that these commitments are kept.”",
            "Heath and the other vets pointed to the change in management in their letter to local officials. They entreated the county to shutter the facility and to prevent the management company from transporting animals to another of its facilities. “When The Dolphin Company purchased Miami Seaquarium, like you, we had high hopes that things were going to change, but they have not,” they wrote. “Because of these violations of Florida law, we urge you to use your power not only to revoke the Dolphin Company’s lease but also to encourage law enforcement to pursue the legal action needed to protect the animals.”"

            "[The president has prioritized military spending over helping American families cover the rising costs of child care.]",
            "[This story was supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.]",
            "IN LATE OCTOBER, President Joe Biden issued two supplemental funding requests. The first, primarily to support Israel’s war on Gaza and Ukraine’s war against Russia, became the $95 billion National Security Act, which the Senate passed in February. This week, Biden urged House leadership to pass the bill as soon as possible.",
            "Never has the president appeared more committed to advancing one of his priorities. Biden delivered a rare Oval Office address specifically to market the plan — something he hasn’t done for any other proposal — and designated the funding as “emergency requirements.” In the weeks and months that followed, he ensured that it remained at the top of Congress’s agenda, even if that meant delays to other legislative business. His hard work paid off: The current bill gives Biden pretty much exactly what he asked for.",
            "The second proposal is half the size of the first and funds domestic programs such as grants to child care providers and disaster relief. This request wasn’t designated as emergency spending.",
            "While Biden personally and repeatedly urged Congress to approve his foreign policy plan, there is not a single instance of him even mentioning his domestic proposal in a statement since offering it on October 25. It hasn’t made an appearance on his personal or presidential X accounts either. Indeed, the way the proposal is written suggests that Biden never intended it to be taken seriously. The foreign policy request is a 69-page, fully drafted legislative proposal that’s formally addressed to the House speaker; the domestic request is a two-page summary table.",
            "The disproportionate amount of political — and regular — capital Biden put into his military spending proposal compared to his domestic, anti-poverty measure characterizes the disconnect between Washington’s idea of “national security” and what security actually means to working-class people and families. If there were alignment, the domestic proposal would be a bill by now.",
            "The National Security Act 2024 puts the U.S. on track to spend more on its military this year than it did annually on average during World War II. Seventy percent of the $95 billion bill is designated for the Pentagon, as is another $886 billion Congress authorized in December. Altogether, the pending fiscal year 2024 Pentagon budget stands at $953 billion.",
            "But as Biden pushes for the largest military budget in the postwar era, 63 percent of U.S. adults say rising prices are a source of hardship; 41 percent report difficulty paying for basic needs like food, housing, child care, and utilities; and 23 percent said they were unable to pay an energy bill in full in the last year. These measures of financial distress are all higher than what they were on average in fiscal years 2021, 2022, or 2023. In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, the president’s focus is on weapons.",
            "The largest provision in the domestic plan is a one-year, $16 billion extension to the American Rescue Plan’s Child Care Stabilization program, which saved the already-fragile child care sector from collapse during the pandemic by keeping workers employed and costs down for families. More than 220,000 child care programs received assistance, including the Sammy Center, a nonprofit preschool in Salt Lake City, Utah. “I am eternally grateful for the stabilization grants,” founder Maria Soter told me. “The funding was my lifeline.”",
            "The expiration of stabilization grants on September 30 set in motion an unfolding disaster. To compensate for the funding shortfall, child care programs across the country are closing, downsizing, cutting wages, or raising costs. In October, more than a third of providers who once received stabilization funding said they had already increased tuition. Knowing she would have to raise tuition at her preschool, Soter said that in the lead-up to the grants’ expiration, “there were nights I didn’t sleep.” Although most parents could afford the extra $300 per month to keep their child enrolled, she lost four students because of the increase.",
            "Absent new stabilization funding, 3.2 million children could lose access to child care. Financial hardship will likely get worse too: Many working parents are now paying more for child care or working less to assume those duties themselves. Households are projected to lose nearly $9 billion in earnings annually from parents reducing their work hours or leaving their jobs entirely to cover the new gaps in child care coverage.",
            "Spending $16 billion on child care would blunt rising financial hardship and promote children’s well-being. The National Security Act, meanwhile, spends $16.5 billion to sustain Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 12,500 Palestinian children.",
            "This bill shouldn’t exist for another reason. Providing military aid to Ukraine wouldn’t require a supplemental bill had Biden not excluded funding for it from the $886 billion Pentagon budget hoping to avoid trade-offs.",
            "To the delight of military contractors, his plan worked. All told, the U.S. arms industry should expect a windfall of about $64 billion from the National Security Act, or four times the money it would take to mitigate America’s child care crisis."

            "CNN EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING the renowned international news anchor Christiane Amanpour, confronted network executives over what the staffers described as myriad leadership failings in coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza, according to a leaked recording of a recent all-hands meeting obtained by The Intercept.",
            "In the hourlong meeting at CNN’s London Bureau on February 13, staffers took turns questioning a panel of executives about CNN’s protocols for covering the war in Gaza and what they describe as a hostile climate for Arab reporters. Several junior and senior CNN employees described feeling devalued, embarrassed, and disgraced by CNN’s war coverage.",
            "The panelists — CNN Worldwide CEO and CNN Editor-in-Chief Mark Thompson, CNN U.S. Executive Editor Virginia Moseley, and CNN International General Manager Mike McCarthy — responded with broad assurances that the employees’ concerns were being heard, while also defending CNN’s work and pointing to the persistent obstacle of gaining access inside the Gaza Strip.",
            "One issue that came up repeatedly is CNN’s longtime process for routing almost all coverage relating to Israel and Palestine through the network’s Jerusalem bureau. As The Intercept reported in January, the protocol — which has existed for years but was expanded and rebranded as SecondEyes last summer — slows down reporting on Gaza and filters news about the war through journalists in Jerusalem who operate under the shadow of Israel’s military censor.",
            "“You’ve heard from me, you’ve heard my, you know, real distress with SecondEyes — changing copy, double standards, and all the rest,” said Amanpour, who was identified in the recording when an executive called her name. “So you’ve heard it, and I hear what your response is and I hope it does go a long way.”",
            "CNN spokesperson Jonathan Hawkins declined to comment on the meeting and pointed The Intercept to the network’s previous statement about SecondEyes, which described it as a process to bring “more expert eyes” to coverage around the clock. “I would add to this that the staff members on this group include Arab staff based outside Israel, and have done since the group was established,” Hawkins said.",
            "Amanpour did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Like other mainstream news organizations, CNN has faced a flood of internal and external criticism of its coverage of Israel and Gaza since October 7, accused of minimizing Palestinian suffering and uncritically amplifying Israeli narratives. Just this week, CNN described an Israeli massacre of more than 100 starving people who were gathered to get food as a “chaotic incident.” Earlier this month, The Guardian published an extensive story sourced to multiple CNN staffers who described the network’s Gaza coverage as “journalistic malpractice.”",
            "During the February meeting, a half-dozen staffers spoke candidly about concerns with CNN’s war coverage. They said the coverage has weakened the network’s standing in the region and has led Arab staffers, some of whom entered lethal situations to cover the war, feeling as though their lives are expendable.",
            "“I was in southern Lebanon during October and November,” one journalist said. “And it was more distressing for me to turn on CNN, than the bombs falling nearby.”",
            "THE MEETING BEGAN as an effort for leadership to discuss editorial priorities. Thompson, in his opening remarks, spoke at length about his vision for evenhanded journalism and reiterated his personal openness to critical exchange and inquiry. “There’s something about the essence of CNN — its brand, what it stands for — which to me is great breaking news, with, right in the middle of the frame, a human being, someone you trust and whose background you know, acting as your guide to what’s happening,” he said.",
            "As soon as the C-suite opened the discussion up to staff questions, the interrogation began.",
            "“My question is about our Gaza coverage,” said the journalist who worked from Lebanon in the fall. “I think it’s no secret that there is a lot of discontent about how the newsgathering process — and how it played out.”",
            "Instead of finding solace in CNN’s coverage of the war, the staffer continued, “I find that my colleagues, my family, are platforming people over and over again, that are either calling for my death, or using very dehumanizing language against me … and people that look like me. And obviously, this has a huge impact in our credibility in the region.”",
            "The journalist posed a question to the executives: “I want to ask as well, what have you done, and what are you doing to address the hate speech that fills our air and informed our coverage, especially in the first few months of the war?”",
            "Thompson responded that he’s generally satisfied with how the network has covered Israel’s war on Gaza, while conceding that “it is impossible to do this kind of story where there are people with incredibly strong opinions on both sides,” without “sometimes making mistakes.” He added that CNN has gotten better at admitting mistakes and trying to correct them and suggested, in response to the staffer’s concerns over dehumanization, that holes in coverage are a consequence of limited access to Gaza.",
            "“I think the fact that it’s been very difficult for us until relatively recently, and even today, to get fully on the ground inside Gaza, has made it hard for us to deliver the kind of individualized personal stories of what it’s been like for the people of Gaza, in the way it has been more possible for us with the story of the families of those murdered and kidnapped by Hamas in the original Hamas attack on Israel,” said Thompson, who answered most of the questions.",
            "If the network had the same access to Gaza as it does to the families of Israeli hostages, he continued, “I believe we would have done the same,” citing a story the network ran about one of its own producers caught in Gaza. “I think that we have for the most part tried very hard to capture the … our job is not to be moral arbiters, it is to report what’s happening.”",
            "Another newsroom staffer chimed in to object to the network’s uncritical coverage of statements by Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “I think a lot of us felt very strongly about the fact that there were very senior anchors not challenging people like, comments like, the defense minister using what is considered under international law, genocidal language, ‘human animals,’ all of those things that made up the first seven pages of the South African legal case at the ICJ,” referring to the International Court of Justice.",
            "The employee then turned to SecondEyes: “If we want a culture that truly values diversity, we need to be really honest about, nobody gets it right. But we did not have our key Jerusalem producers on that Jerusalem SecondEyes — we didn’t have an Arab on it for some time.”",
            "The staffer went on to say that Muslim or Arab journalists at CNN were made to feel that they must denounce Hamas to clear their names and be taken seriously as journalists. “I’ve heard this, where a number of younger colleagues now feel that they didn’t want to put their hands up to speak up even in the kind of the local Bureau meeting,” the staffer said. “People were taking their names off bylines.”",
            "Thompson interjected, saying that people seemed to be speaking up now and that he welcomes editorial discussions.",
            "Another staffer disputed that characterization and noted that Arab and Muslim journalists walk a difficult line between feeling proud of working for CNN while facing pressure from their families and communities over working for a network with a pronounced pro-Israel bias.",
            "“I think it’s very important for you to know that the degree of racism that those of us of Arab and Muslim descent face inside Israel, covering Israel, was disproportionate — the targeting of us by pro Israeli organizations, and what we had to hear,” another staffer added.",
            "Amanpour chimed in toward the end of the meeting. She praised the reports of Clarissa Ward, Nada Bashir, and Jomana Karadsheh and suggested that CNN should have more experts like them on the ground and in the field, especially at the start of a conflict.",
            "“Bottom line, we do actually have to send experts to these unbelievably difficult, contentious, you know, game-changing stories,” said Amanpour, a veteran war reporter. “It isn’t a place, with due respect, to send people who we want to promote or whatever, or teach. Maybe in the second wave, maybe in the third wave — but in the first wave, it has to be the people who know, through experience, what they’re seeing, and how to speak truth to power on all sides. And how to recognize the difference between political or whatever or terrorist attack, and the humanity, and to be able to put all of that into reporting.”",
            "“For me, video is not a talking head on a balcony in a capital,” Amanpour said. “It just isn’t. To me, video is reportage.”"

            "[The Story Behind the New York Times October 7 Exposé]",
            "ANAT SCHWARTZ HAD a problem. The Israeli filmmaker and former air force intelligence official had been assigned by the New York Times to work with her partner’s nephew Adam Sella and veteran Times reporter Jeffrey Gettleman on an investigation into sexual violence by Hamas on October 7 that could reshape the way the world understood Israel’s ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. By November, global opposition was mounting against Israel’s military campaign, which had already killed thousands of children, women, and the elderly. On her social media feed, which the Times has since said it is reviewing, Schwartz liked a tweet saying that Israel needed to “turn the strip into a slaughterhouse.”",
            "“Violate any norm, on the way to victory,” read the post. “Those in front of us are human animals who do not hesitate to violate minimal rules.”",
            "The New York Times, however, does have rules and norms. Schwartz had no prior reporting experience. Her reporting partner Gettleman explained the basics to her, Schwartz said in a podcast interview on January 3, produced by Israel’s Channel 12 and conducted in Hebrew.",
            "Gettleman, she said, was concerned they “get at least two sources for every detail we put into the article, cross-check information. Do we have forensic evidence? Do we have visual evidence? Apart from telling our reader ‘this happened,’ what can we say? Can we tell what happened to whom?”",
            "Schwartz said she was initially reluctant to take the assignment because she did not want to look at visual images of potential assaults and because she lacked the expertise to conduct such an investigation.",
            "“Victims of sexual assault are women who have experienced something, and then to come and sit in front of such a woman — who am I anyway?” she said. “I have no qualifications.”",
            "Nonetheless, she began working with Gettleman on the story, she explained in the podcast interview. Gettleman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, is an international correspondent, and when he is sent to a bureau, he works with news assistants and freelancers on stories. In this case, several newsroom sources familiar with the process said, Schwartz and Sella did the vast majority of the ground reporting, while Gettleman focused on the framing and writing.",
            "The resulting report, published in late December, was headlined “‘Screams Without Words’: How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct. 7.” It was a bombshell and galvanized the Israeli war effort at a time when even some of Israel’s allies were expressing concern over its large-scale killing of civilians in Gaza. Inside the newsroom, the article was met with praise from editorial leaders but skepticism from other Times journalists. The paper’s flagship podcast “The Daily” attempted to turn the article into an episode, but it didn’t manage to get through a fact check, as The Intercept previously reported. (In a statement received after publication, a Times spokesperson said, “No Daily episode was killed due to fact checking failures.”)",
            "The fear among Times staffers who have been critical of the paper’s Gaza coverage is that Schwartz will become a scapegoat for what is a much deeper failure. She may harbor animosity toward Palestinians, lack the experience with investigative journalism, and feel conflicting pressures between being a supporter of Israel’s war effort and a Times reporter, but Schwartz did not commission herself and Sella to report one of the most consequential stories of the war. Senior leadership at the New York Times did.",
            "Schwartz said as much in an interview with Israeli Army Radio on December 31. “The New York Times said, ‘Let’s do an investigation into sexual violence’ — it was more a case of them having to convince me,” she said. Her host cut her off: “It was a proposal of The New York Times, the entire thing?”",
            "“Unequivocally. Unequivocally. Obviously. Of course,” she said. “The paper stood behind us 200 percent and gave us the time, the investment, the resources to go in-depth with this investigation as much as needed.”",
            "Shortly after the war broke out, some editors and reporters complained that Times standards barred them from referring to Hamas as “terrorists.” The rationale from the standards department, run for 14 years by Philip Corbett, had long been that Hamas was the de facto administrator of a specific territory, rather than a stateless terror group. Deliberately killing civilians, went the argument, was not enough to label a group terrorists, as that label could apply quite broadly.",
            "Corbett, after October 7, defended the policy in the face of pressure, newsroom sources said, but he lost. On October 19, an email went out on behalf of Executive Editor Joe Kahn saying that Corbett had asked to step back from his position. “After 14 years as the embodiment of Times standards, Phil Corbett has told us he’d like to step back a bit and let someone else take the leading role in this crucial effort,” Times leadership explained. Three newsroom sources said the move was tied to the pressure he was under to soften coverage in Israel’s favor. One of the social media posts that Schwartz liked, triggering the Times review, made the case that, for Israeli propaganda purposes, Hamas should be likened at all times to the Islamic State. A Times spokesperson told The Intercept, “Your understanding about Phil Corbett is flatly untrue.” In a statement received after publication, “Phil had asked to change roles before Joe Kahn even became executive editor in June 2022. And it had absolutely nothing to do with a dispute over coverage.”",
            "Since the revelations regarding Schwartz’s recent social media activity, her byline has not appeared in the paper and she has not attended editorial meetings. The paper said that a review into her social media “likes” is ongoing. “Those ‘likes’’ are unacceptable violations of our company policy,” said a Times spokesperson.",
            "The bigger scandal may be the reporting itself, the process that allowed it into print, and the life-altering impact the reporting had for thousands of Palestinians whose deaths were justified by the alleged systematic sexual violence orchestrated by Hamas the paper claimed to have exposed.",
            "Another frustrated Times reporter who has also worked as an editor there said, “A lot of focus will understandably, rightfully, be directed at Schwartz but this is most clearly poor editorial decision making that undermines all the other great work being tirelessly done across the paper — both related and completely unrelated to the war — that manages to challenge our readers and meet our standards.”",
            "The Channel 12 podcast interview with Schwartz, which The Intercept translated from Hebrew, opens a window into the reporting process on the controversial story and suggests that The New York Times’s mission was to bolster a predetermined narrative.",
            "In a response to The Intercept’s questions about Schwartz’s podcast interview, a spokesperson for the New York Times walked back the blockbuster article’s framing that evidence shows Hamas had weaponized sexual violence to a softer claim that “there may have been systematic use of sexual assault.”",
            "Times International editor Phil Pan said in a statement that he stands by the work. “Ms. Schwartz was part of a rigorous reporting and editing process,” he said. “She made valuable contributions and we saw no evidence of bias in her work. We remain confident in the accuracy of our reporting and stand by the team’s investigation. But as we have said, her ‘likes’ of offensive and opinionated social media posts, predating her work with us, are unacceptable.”",
            "After this story was published, Schwartz, who did not respond to a request for comment, tweeted to thank the Times for “standing behind the important stories we have published.” She added, “The recent attacks against me will not deter me from continuing my work.” Addressing her social media activity, Schwartz said, “I understand why people who do not know me were offended by the inadvertent ‘like’ I pressed on 10/7 and I apologize for that.” At least three of her “likes” have been the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "In the podcast interview, Schwartz details her extensive efforts to get confirmation from Israeli hospitals, rape crisis centers, trauma recovery facilities, and sex assault hotlines in Israel, as well as her inability to get a single confirmation from any of them. “She was told there had been no complaints made of sexual assaults,” the Times spokesperson acknowledged after The Intercept brought the Channel 12 podcast episode to the paper’s attention. “This however was just the very first step of her research. She then describes the unfolding of evidence, testimonies, and eventual evidence that there may have been systematic use of sexual assault,” the spokesperson asserted. “She details her research steps and emphasizes the Times’s strict standards to corroborate evidence, and meetings with reporters and editors to discuss probing questions and think critically about the story.”",
            "The question has never been whether individual acts of sexual assault may have occurred on October 7. Rape is not uncommon in war, and there were also several hundred civilians who poured into Israel from Gaza that day in a “second wave,” contributing to and participating in the mayhem and violence. The central issue is whether the New York Times presented solid evidence to support its claim that there were newly reported details “establishing that the attacks against women were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence on Oct. 7” — a claim stated in the headline that Hamas deliberately deployed sexual violence as a weapon of war.",
            "SCHWARTZ BEGAN HER work on the violence of October 7 where one would expect, by calling around to the designated “Room 4” facilities in 11 Israeli hospitals that examine and treat potential victims of sexual violence, including rape. “First thing I called them all, and they told me, ‘No, no complaint of sexual assault was received,’” she recalled in the podcast interview. “I had a lot of interviews which didn’t lead anywhere. Like, I would go to all kinds of psychiatric hospitals, sit in front of the staff, all of them are fully committed to the mission and no one had met a victim of sexual assault.”",
            "The next step was to call the manager of the sexual assault hotline in Israel’s south, which proved equally fruitless. The manager told her they had no reports of sexual violence. She described the call as a “crazy in-depth conversation” where she pressed for specific cases. “Did anyone call you? Did you hear anything?” she recalled asking. “How could it be that you didn’t?”",
            "As Schwartz began her own efforts to find evidence of sexual assault, the first specific allegations of rape began to emerge. A person identified in anonymous media interviews as a paramedic from the Israeli Air Force medical unit 669 claimed he saw evidence that two teenage girls at Kibbutz Nahal Oz had been raped and murdered in their bedroom. The man made other outrageous claims, however, that called his report into question. He claimed another rescuer “pulled out of the garbage” a baby who’d been stabbed multiple times. He also said he had seen “Arabic sentences that were written on entrances to houses … with the blood of the people that were living in the houses.” No such messages exist, and the story of the baby in the trash can has been debunked. The bigger problem was that no two girls at the kibbutz fit the source’s description. In future interviews, he changed the location to Kibbutz Be’eri. But no victims killed there matched the description either, as Mondoweiss reported.",
            "After seeing these interviews, Schwartz started calling people at Kibbutz Be’eri and other kibbutzim that were targeted on October 7 in an effort to track down the story. “Nothing. There was nothing,” she said. “No one saw or heard anything.” She then reached the unit 669 paramedic who relayed to Schwartz the same story he had told other media outlets, which she says convinced her there was a systematic nature to the sexual violence. “I say, ‘OK, so it happened, one person saw it happen in Be’eri, so it can’t be just one person, because it’s two girls. It’s sisters. It’s in the room. Something about it is systematic, something about it feels to me that it’s not random,” Schwartz concluded on the podcast.",
            "Schwartz said she then began a series of extensive conversations with Israeli officials from Zaka, a private ultra-Orthodox rescue organization that has been documented to have mishandled evidence and spread multiple false stories about the events of October 7, including debunked allegations of Hamas operatives beheading babies and cutting the fetus from a pregnant woman’s body. Its workers are not trained forensic scientists or crime scene experts. “When we go into a house, we use our imagination,” said Yossi Landau, a senior Zaka official, describing the group’s work at the October 7 attack sites. “The bodies were telling us what happened, that’s what happened.” Landau is featured in the Times report, though no mention is made of his well-documented track record of disseminating sensational stories of atrocities that were later proven false. Schwartz said that in her initial interviews, Zaka members did not make any specific allegations of rape, but described the general condition of bodies they said they saw. “They told me, ‘Yes, we saw naked women,’ or ‘We saw a woman without underwear.’ Both naked without underwear, and tied with zip ties. And sometimes not zip ties, sometimes a rope or a string of a hoodie.”",
            "Schwartz continued to look for evidence at various sites of attack and found no witnesses to corroborate stories of rape. “And so I searched a lot in the kibbutzim, and apart from this testimony of [the Israeli military paramedic] and additionally, here and there, Zaka people — the stories, like, didn’t emerge from there,” she said.",
            "As she continued to work the phones with rescue officials, Schwartz then saw interviews that international news channels began airing with Shari Mendes, an American architect who serves in a rabbinical unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Mendes, who was deployed to a morgue to prepare bodies for burial after the October 7 attacks, claimed to have seen voluminous evidence of sexual assaults.",
            "“We saw evidence of rape,” Mendes stated in one interview. “Pelvises were broken, and it probably takes a lot to break a pelvis … and this was also among grandmothers down to small children. This is not just something we saw on the internet, we saw these bodies with our own eyes.” Mendes has been a ubiquitous figure in the Israeli government and major media narratives on sexual violence on October 7, despite the fact that she has no medical or forensic credentials to legally determine rape. She had also spoken about other violence on October 7, telling the Daily Mail in October, “A baby was cut out of a pregnant woman and beheaded and then the mother was beheaded.” No pregnant woman died that day, according to the official Israeli list of those killed in the attacks, and the independent research collective October 7 Fact Check said Mendes’s story was false.",
            "After Schwartz saw interviews with Mendes, she was further convinced that the systematic rape narrative was true. “I’m like — wow, what is this?” she recalled. “And it feels to me like it’s starting to approach a plurality, even if you don’t know which numbers to put on it yet.”",
            "At the same time, Schwartz said that she felt conflicted at times, wondering if she was becoming convinced of the truth of the overarching story precisely because she was looking for evidence to support the claim. “I kept wondering all the time, whether if I just hear about rape and see rape and think about it, whether that’s just because I’m leading toward that,” she said. She pushed those doubts aside. By the time Schwartz interviewed Mendes, the IDF reservist’s story had ricocheted around the world and been conclusively debunked: No baby was cut from a mother and beheaded. Yet Schwartz and the New York Times would go on to rely on Mendes’s testimony, as well as those of other witnesses with track records of making unreliable claims and lacking forensic credentials. No mention was made of questions about Mendes’s credibility.",
            "HOW SCHWARTZ LANDED in such an extraordinary position at a crucial moment in the war is not entirely clear. Prior to joining the Times as a stringer last fall, Sella was a freelance journalist covering stories on issues ranging from “food, photography, and culture to peace efforts, economics, and the occupation,” according to his LinkedIn profile. Sella’s first collaboration with Gettleman, published on October 14, was a look at the trauma experienced by students at a university in southern Israel. For Schwartz, her first byline landed on November 14.",
            "“Israeli police officials shared more evidence on Tuesday of atrocities committed during the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, saying they had collected testimonies from more than a thousand witnesses and survivors about sexual violence and other abuses,” Schwartz reported. The story went on to quote Israel’s police chief, Kobi Shabtai, explaining a litany of evidence of gruesome killings and sexual assaults on October 7.",
            "“This is the most extensive investigation the State of Israel has ever known,” Shabtai said in the Schwartz article, promising ample evidence would soon be provided.",
            "When the Times later produced its definitive “Screams Without Words” investigation, however, Schwartz and her partners reported that, contrary to Shabtai’s claim, forensic evidence of sexual violence was non-existent. Without acknowledging the past statements by Shabtai in the Times, the paper reported that quick funerals in accordance with Jewish tradition meant evidence was not preserved. Experts told the Times that sexual violence in wars often leaves “limited forensic evidence.”",
            "On the podcast, Schwartz said her next step was to go to a new holistic therapy facility established to address the trauma of October 7 victims, particularly those who endured the carnage at the Nova music festival. Opened a week after the attacks, the facility began welcoming hundreds of survivors where they could seek counseling, do yoga, and receive alternative medicine, as well as acupuncture, sound healing, and reflexology treatments. They called it Merhav Marpe, or Healing Space.",
            "In multiple visits to Merhav Marpe, Schwartz again said in the podcast interview that she found no direct evidence of rapes or sexual violence. She expressed frustration with the therapists and counselors at the facility, saying they engaged in “a conspiracy of silence.” “Everyone, even those who heard these kinds of things from people, they felt very committed to their patients, or even just to people who assisted their patients, not to reveal things,” she said.",
            "In the end, Schwartz came away with only innuendo and general statements from the therapists about how people process trauma, including sexual violence and rape. She said potential victims might be ashamed to speak out, experiencing survivors’ guilt, or were still in shock. “Perhaps also because Israeli society is conservative, there was some inclination to keep silent about this issue of sexual abuse,” Schwartz speculated. “On top of this, there is probably the added dimension of the religious-national aspect, that this was done by a terrorist, by someone from Hamas,” she added. “There were lots and lots of layers that made it so that they didn’t speak.”",
            "According to the published Times article, “Two therapists said they were working with a woman who was gang raped at the rave and was in no condition to talk to investigators or reporters.”",
            "Schwartz said she had focused on the kibbutzim because she had initially determined it was unlikely sexual assaults had occurred at the Nova music festival. “I was very skeptical that it happened at the area of the party, because everyone I spoke to among the survivors told me about a chase, a race, like, about moving from place to place,” she recalled. “How would they [have had the time] to mess with a woman, like — it is impossible. Either you hide, or you — or you die. Also it’s public, the Nova … such an open space.”",
            "SCHWARTZ WATCHED INTERVIEWS given to international media outlets by Raz Cohen, who attended the Nova festival. A veteran of Israel’s special forces, Cohen did multiple interviews about a rape he claimed to have witnessed. A few days after the attacks, he told PBS NewsHour that he had witnessed multiple rapes. “The terrorists, people from Gaza, raped girls. And after they raped them, they killed them, murdered them with knives, or the opposite, killed — and after they raped, they — they did that,” he said. At an appearance on CNN on January 4, he described seeing one rape and said the assailants were “five guys — five civilians from Gaza, normal guys, not soldiers, not Nukhba,” referring to Hamas’s elite commando force. “It was regular people from Gaza with normal clothes.”",
            "In Cohen’s interview with Schwartz for the Times:",
            "He said he then saw five men, wearing civilian clothes, all carrying knives and one carrying a hammer, dragging a woman across the ground. She was young, naked and screaming.",
            "‘They all gather around her,’ Mr. Cohen said. ‘She’s standing up. They start raping her. I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words.”",
            "“Then one of them raises a knife,” he said, “and they just slaughtered her.”",
            "It was this interview that gave the Times its title: “‘Screams Without Words’: How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct. 7.” That Cohen had described alleged assailants as not being members of Hamas undermines the headline, but it remains unchanged. The Times did not address Cohen’s earlier claims that he witnessed multiple rapes.",
            "Schwartz said in the podcast interview that, since the Times insisted on at least two sources, she asked Cohen to give her the contact information of the other people he was hiding with in the bush, so she could corroborate his story of the rape. She recalled, “Raz hides. In the bush next to him lies his friend Shoam. They get to this bush. There are two other people on the other side looking to the other direction, and another, fifth, person. Five people in the same bush. Only Raz sees all the things he sees, everyone else is looking in a different direction.”",
            "Despite saying on the podcast that only Cohen witnessed the event and the others were looking in different directions, in the Times story Shoam Gueta is presented as a corroborating witness to the rape: “He said he saw at least four men step out of the van and attack the woman, who ended up ‘between their legs.’ He said that they were ‘talking, giggling and shouting,’ and that one of them stabbed her with a knife repeatedly, ‘literally butchering her.’” Gueta did not mention witnessing a rape in an interview he did with NBC News on October 8, a day after the attack, but he did describe seeing a woman murdered with a knife. “We saw terrorists killing people, burning cars, shouting everywhere,” Gueta told NBC. “If you just say something, if you make any noise, you’ll be murdered.” Gueta subsequently deployed to Gaza with the IDF and has posted many videos on TikTok of himself rummaging through Palestinian homes. Cohen and Gueta did not respond to requests for comment.",
            "The independent site October 7 Fact Check, Mondoweiss, and journalists Ali Abunimah of Electronic Intifada and Max Blumenthal of The Grayzone have flagged numerous inconsistencies and contradictions in the stories told in the Times report, including the account of Cohen, who had initially said “he chose not to look, but he could hear them laughing constantly.”",
            "Under pressure internally to defend the veracity of the story, the Times reassigned Gettleman, Schwartz, and Sella to effectively re-report the story, resulting in an article published on January 29. Cohen declined to speak to them, they reported: “Asked this month why he had not mentioned rape at first, Mr. Cohen cited the stress of his experience, and said in a text message that he had not realized then that he was one of the few surviving witnesses. He declined to be interviewed again, saying he was working to recover from the trauma he suffered.”",
            "In addition to Cohen’s testimony, Schwartz said on the Channel 12 podcast that she also watched video of an interrogation of a Palestinian prisoner taken by the IDF whom she said described “girls” being dragged by Palestinian attackers into the woods near the Nova festival. She was also moved, she said, by a clip of an interview she watched in November at a press conference hosted by Israeli officials, the one that became the focus of her first Times article.",
            "An accountant named Sapir described a lurid scene of rape and mutilation, and Schwartz said she became fully convinced there was a systematic program of sexual violence by Hamas. “Her testimony is crazy, and hair-raising, and huge, and barbaric,” Schwartz said. “And it’s not just rape — it’s rape, and amputation, and … and I realize it’s a bigger story than I imagined, [with] many locations, and then the picture starts to emerge, What is going on here?”",
            "The Times report states they interviewed Sapir for two hours at a cafe in southern Israel, and she described witnessing multiple rapes, including an incident where one attacker rapes a woman as another cuts off her breast with a box cutter.",
            "At the press conference in November, Israeli authorities said they were collecting and examining forensic materials that would confirm Sapir’s specifically detailed accounts. “Police say they are still gathering evidence (DNA etc) from rape victims in addition to eyewitnesses to build the strongest case possible,” said a correspondent who covered the press event. Such a scene would produce significant amounts of physical evidence, yet Israeli officials have, to date, been unable to provide it. “I have circumstantial evidence, but in the end, it’s my duty to find supporting evidence for her story and discover the victims’ identities,” said Superintendent Adi Edri, the Israeli official leading the investigation into sexual violence on October 7, a week after the Times report went online. “At this stage, I have no specific bodies.”",
            "In the Channel 12 podcast, Schwartz is asked if firsthand testimonies of women who survived rape on October 7 exist. “I can’t really speak about this, but the vast majority of women who have been sexually assaulted on October 7 were shot immediately after, and that’s [where] the big numbers [are],” she replied. “The majority are corpses. Some women managed to escape and survive.” She added, “I do know that there is a very significant element of dissociation when it comes to sexual assault. So a lot of times they don’t remember. They don’t remember everything. They remember fragments of the events, and they can’t always describe how they ended up on the road and [how they were] rescued.”",
            "In early December, Israeli officials launched an intensive public campaign, accusing the international community and specifically feminist leaders of standing silent in the face of the widespread, systemic sexual violence of Hamas’s October 7 attack. The PR effort was rolled out at the United Nations on December 4, with an event hosted by the Israeli ambassador and the former Meta executive Sheryl Sandberg. The feminist organizations targeted by the pro-Israel figures were caught flat-footed, as charges of sexual violence had not yet circulated widely.",
            "Sandberg was also quoted attacking women’s rights organizations in a December 4 New York Times article, headlined “What We Know About Sexual Violence During the Oct. 7 Attacks on Israel” and whose publication coincided with the launch of the PR campaign at the U.N. The article, also reported by Gettleman, Schwartz, and Sella, relied on claims made by Israeli officials and acknowledged the Times had not yet been able to corroborate the allegations. A revealing correction was subsequently appended to the story: “An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of evidence Israeli police have gathered in investigating accusations of sexual violence committed on Oct. 7 in the attack by Hamas against Israel. The police are relying mainly on witness testimony, not on autopsies or forensic evidence.”",
            "Israel promised it had extraordinary amounts of eyewitness testimony. “Investigators have gathered ‘tens of thousands’ of testimonies of sexual violence committed by Hamas on Oct. 7, according to the Israeli police, including at the site of a music festival that was attacked,” Schwartz, Gettleman, and Stella reported on December 4. Those testimonies never materialized.",
            "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hammered on the theme in a December 5 speech in Tel Aviv. “I say to the women’s rights organizations, to the human rights organizations, you’ve heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation? Where the hell are you?” The same day, President Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said, “The world can’t just look away — what’s going on. It’s on all of us — the government, international organizations, civil society, individual citizens — to forcefully condemn the sexual violence of Hamas terrorists without equivocation — without equivocation, without exception.”",
            "The two-month-long Times investigation was still being edited and revised, Schwartz said in the podcast, when she started to feel concerned about the timing. “So I said, ‘We’re missing momentum. Maybe the U.N. isn’t addressing sexual assault because no [media outlet] will come out with a declaration about what happened there.’” If the Times story doesn’t publish soon, she said, “it may no longer be interesting.” Schwartz said the delay was explained to her internally as, “We don’t want to make people sad before Christmas.”",
            "She also said that Israeli police sources were pressuring her to move quickly to publish. She said they asked her, “What, does the New York Times not believe there were sexual assaults here?” Schwartz felt like she was in the middle.",
            "“I’m also in this place, I’m also an Israeli, but I also work for New York Times,” she said. “So all the time I’m like in this place between the hammer and the anvil.”",
            "THE DECEMBER 28 article “Screams Without Words” opened with the story of Gal Abdush, described by the Times as “the woman in the black dress.” Video of her charred body appeared to show her bottomless. “Israeli police officials said they believed that Ms. Abdush was raped,” the Times reported. The article labeled Abdush “a symbol of the horrors visited upon Israeli women and girls during the October 7 attacks.” The Times report mentions WhatsApp messages from Abdush and her husband to their family, but doesn’t mention that some family members believe that the crucial messages make the Israeli officials’ claims implausible. As Mondoweiss later reported, Abdush texted the family at 6:51 a.m., saying they were in trouble at the border. At 7:00, her husband messaged to say she’d been killed. Her family said the charring came from a grenade.",
            "“It doesn’t make any sense,”said Abdush’s sister, that in a short timespan “they raped her, slaughtered her, and burned her?” Speaking about the rape allegation, her brother-in-law said: “The media invented it.”",
            "Another relative suggested the family was pressured, under false pretenses, to speak with the reporters. Abdush’s sister wrote on Instagram that the Times reporters “mentioned they want to write a report in memory of Gal, and that’s it. If we knew that the title would be about rape and butchery, we’d never accept that.” In its follow-up story, the Times sought to discredit her initial comment, quoting Abdush’s sister as saying she “had been ‘confused about what happened’ and was trying to ‘protect my sister.’”",
            "The woman who filmed Abdush on October 7 told the Israeli site YNet that Schwartz and Sella had pressured her into giving the paper access to her photos and videos for the purposes of serving Israeli propaganda. “They called me again and again and explained how important it is to Israeli hasbara,” she recalled, using the term for public diplomacy, which in practice refers to Israeli propaganda efforts directed at international audiences.",
            "At every turn, when the New York Times reporters ran into obstacles confirming tips, they turned to anonymous Israeli officials or witnesses who’d already been interviewed repeatedly in the press. Months after setting off on their assignment, the reporters found themselves exactly where they had begun, relying overwhelmingly on the word of Israeli officials, soldiers, and Zaka workers to substantiate their claim that more than 30 bodies of women and girls were discovered with signs of sexual abuse. On the Channel 12 podcast, Schwartz said the last remaining piece she needed for the story was a solid number from the Israeli authorities about any possible survivors of sexual violence. “We have four and we can stand behind that number,” she said she was told by the Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. No details were provided. The Times story ultimately reported there were “at least three women and one man who were sexually assaulted and survived.”",
            "When the story was finally published on December 28 Schwartz described the flood of emotions and reactions online and in Israel. “First of all, in the paper, we gave it a very, very prominent place, which is, apropos all my fears — there is no greater show of confidence than being put on the front page,” she said. “In Israel, the reactions are amazing. Here I think I was given closure, seeing that all the media treat the article and treat it as something of [a] thank you for putting a number on it. Thank you for saying there were many cases, that it was a pattern. Thank you for giving it a title which suggests that maybe there is some organizing logic behind it, that this is not some isolated act of some person acting on his own initiative.”",
            "Times staffers who spoke to The Intercept on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional reprisal described the “Screams Without Words” article as the product of the same mistakes that led to the disastrous editor’s note and retraction on Rukmini Callimachi’s podcast “Caliphate” and print series on the Islamic State group. Kahn, the current executive editor, was widely known as a promoter and protector of Callimachi. The reporting, which the Times determined in an internal review was not subjected to sufficient scrutiny by top editors and fell short of the paper’s standards on ensuring accuracy, had been a finalist for a 2019 Pulitzer Prize. That honor, along with other prestigious awards, was rescinded in the wake of the scandal.",
            "Margaret Sullivan, the last public editor for the New York Times to serve a full term before the paper discarded the position in 2017, said that she hopes such an investigation will be launched into the “Screams Without Words” story. “I sometimes joke ‘it’s another good day not to be the New York Times public editor’ but the organization could *really* use one right now to investigate on behalf of the readers,” she wrote.",
            "At some story meetings, Schwartz said on the Channel 12 podcast, editors with Middle East expertise were there to offer probing questions. “We had a weekly meeting, and you bring out the status of your work on your project,” she said. “And Times writers and editors who are concerned with Middle Eastern affairs coming from all kinds of places in the world, they ask you questions that challenge you, and it’s excellent that they do that, because you yourself, all the time, like — you don’t believe yourself for a moment.”",
            "Those questions were challenging to answer, she said: “One of the questions you get asked — and it’s the hardest ones to not be able to answer — if this has happened in so many places, how can it be that there is no forensic evidence? How can it be that there is no documentation? How can it be that there are no records? A report? An Excel spreadsheet? You are telling me about Shari [Mendes]? That’s someone who saw with her own eyes, and is now speaking to you — is there no [written] report to make what she’s saying authoritative?”",
            "The host interjected. “And you went at that stage to those official Israeli authorities, and asked that they give you — something, anything. And how did they respond?”",
            "“‘There is nothing,’” Schwartz said she was told. “‘There was no collection of evidence from the scene.’”",
            "But broadly, she said, the editors were fully behind the project. “There was no skepticism on their part, ever,” she claimed. “It still doesn’t mean I had [the story], because I didn’t have a ‘second source’ for many things.”",
            "A Times spokesperson pointed to this portion of the interview as evidence of the paper’s rigorous process: “We have reviewed the wider transcript and it’s clear you’re persisting in taking quotes out of context. In the portion of the interview you refer to, Anat describes being encouraged by editors to corroborate evidence and sources before we’d publish the investigation. Later, she discusses regular meetings with editors where they would ask ‘hard’ and ‘challenging’ questions, and the time it took to undertake the second and third stages of sourcing. This is all part of a rigorous reporting process and one which we continue to stand behind.”",
            "In her interview with the Channel 12 podcast, Schwartz said she began working with Gettleman soon after October 7. “My job was to help him. He had all kinds of thoughts about things, about articles he wanted to do,” she recalled. “On the first day, there were already three things on [his] lineup, and then I saw that at number three was ‘Sexual Violence.’” Schwartz said that in the initial aftermath of the October 7 attacks, there was not much focus on sexual assaults, but by the time she began working for Gettleman, rumors began spreading that such acts had taken place, most of it based on the commentary of Zaka workers and IDF officials and soldiers.",
            "After the article was published, Gettleman was invited to speak on a panel about sexual violence at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. His efforts were lauded by the panel and its host, Sandberg, the former Facebook executive. Instead of doubling down on reporting that helped win the New York Times a prestigious Polk Award, Gettleman dismissed the need for reporters to provide “evidence.”",
            "“What we found — I don’t want to even use the word ‘evidence,’ because evidence is almost like a legal term that suggests you’re trying to prove an allegation or prove a case in court,” Gettleman told Sandberg. “That’s not my role. We all have our roles. And my role is to document, is to present information, is to give people a voice. And we found information along the entire chain of violence, so of sexual violence.”",
            "Gettleman said his mission was to move people. “It’s really difficult to get this information and then to shape it,” he said. “That’s our job as journalists: to get the information and to share the story in a way that makes people care. Not just to inform, but to move people. And that’s what I’ve been doing for a long time.”",
            "One Times reporter said colleagues are wondering what a balanced approach might look like: “I am waiting to see if the paper will report in depth, deploying the same kind of resources and means, on the United Nations’ report that documented the horrors committed against Palestinian women.”",

            "[He stole Supreme Court seats, thwarted accountability for Donald Trump, and left a trail of partisan destruction in his wake.]",
            "On February 7, 2017, one of the darker days of his long, dark tenure as one of the most cynical partisans ever to serve in the Senate, then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prevented Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren from reading aloud a historic letter from Coretta Scott King that recalled some of the worst abuses of voting rights by then-Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Sessions, a conservative Republican whose nomination to serve as then-President Donald Trump’s first Attorney General was under consideration by the chamber, was an ally of McConnell’s. More importantly, he was a fellow Republican. And the all-powerful majority leader decided he had heard more than enough criticism about his partisan compatriot’s sordid history of seeking to suppress the Black vote in Alabama.",
            "So McConnell employed a rule that bars a senator from ascribing “to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator” to silence his Democratic colleague—even though Warren was merely reading a letter from the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that described actual events and that was already a part of the Congressional Record. Sputtering with frustration, the majority leader went to the floor and infamously grumbled in his scolding tone, “Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”",
            "Seven years later, Warren still persists, having long ago turned McConnell’s words into a rallying cry for progressive women. She’s all but certain to win a new term, extending a distinguished Senate career that is likely to see her rise to the chairmanship of one or more key committees. Her contribution to the chamber has been great, and it will be greater.",
            "McConnell, on the other hand, is calling it quits after 17 years as the Senate Republican leader—six of them as majority leader—in which he invariably put party ahead of country and did more long-term damage to American democracy than any member of the Senate in modern US history.",
            "McConnell is the longest-serving Senate leader ever, but he is headed for the exits at the nadir of his power. If he once ruled as a mighty “lion of the Senate,” he leaves as something more like an 82-year-old toothless tiger. He’s now the minority leader in a chamber led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. The Republican who once shaped the party’s direction not just on Capitol Hill but in Senate races across the country is on the outs with the base of a Grand Old Party where Trump—who despises McConnell—has shaped a cult of personality so intense that no room is left for leaders other than the former president. When McConnell returns to his home state for political events, he is heckled and met with cries of “Retire!” Now he has begun the process of heeding those calls.",
            "“One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,” McConnell told colleagues Wednesday. “So I stand before you today… to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.”",
            "But don’t fret for McConnell, who will keep collecting his government checks, while he serves out the remainder of his seventh term. If awards are being handed out for political longevity, give him one. But McConnell’s record of partisan conniving and moral compromising merits no applause.",
            "One of two current senators who witnessed the 1963 March of Washington for Jobs and Freedom—he was a sympathetic House intern looking on from near the Capitol, while Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, marched and rallied with the massive crowd of civil rights activists—McConnell arrived in the Senate in 1985 with a record as a something of a moderate on issues of race and labor rights, like his Kentucky mentors, Republican Senators John Sherman Cooper and Marlow Cook. But he quickly adjusted himself to the rightward thrust of a party in the thrall of then-President Ronald Reagan.",
            "Where Cooper had courageously opposed Republican President Richard Nixon’s pursuit of the Vietnam War, and where Cook cast a decisive vote in opposition to Nixon’s nomination of Judge G. Harrold Carswell, a Georgian with a track record of supporting segregation, to serve on the US Supreme Court, McConnell became the ultimate GOP hack. When it mattered most, he put party above the cooperation, party above the common good, party above the truth, and, ultimately, party above the Constitution.",
            "McConnell once notoriously declared that his highest political priority was unseating Democratic President Barack Obama, and he constantly manifested that same level of remorseless partisanship. Even when Obama was advancing legislation that would help Kentucky, in the form of the Affordable Care Act, McConnell moved to block it, leading a frustrated Cook to denounce his former aide and say, “If he had any knowledge of the lack of health and medical facilities in the hills of Kentucky, he’d know it’s a problem we need to solve. For Mitch McConnell to decide the new health program is not good for Kentucky—it tells me he’s not looking out for his own constituency.”",
            "As Capitol Hill’s most ardent advocate for big money in politics, and a prodigious fundraiser, McConnell kept his seat. And he used his growing power in the Senate to engage in ever more egregious acts of partisanship. Perhaps most brazenly, his cynical manipulation of the judicial confirmation process in 2016 prevented consideration of Judge Merrick Garland, a highly qualified if blandly moderate federal jurist, to serve on the US Supreme Court.",
            "McConnell’s refusal to allow the Senate to take up the Garland nomination relied on an obvious lie: the claim that the Senate could not weigh high court nominations in presidential election years. In fact, the then-majority leader was simply keeping the seat open until a Republican president could fill it with a right-wing judicial activist. After Donald Trump’s election, McConnell promptly steered Neil Gorsuch to confirmation in 2017. Then, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death created an election-year opening on the court in 2020, McConnell shamelessly raced to fill the seat with conservative Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett—finishing his long mission of tipping the balance on the court so that it had an aggressively hard-right, anti-abortion majority. In less than two years, 50 years of precedent was overturned, as McConnell’s court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the way for states to block access to reproductive rights.",
            "It is fair to say that McConnell’s judicial machinations will be his longest-lasting legacy. Decades from now, Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, whose tenures McConnell made possible, will be undermining civil liberties and upending protections for economic, social, and racial justice. But there is a powerful case that McConnell’s most miserable dereliction of duty came when he defended a Republican president he didn’t even like—and who didn’t like him.",
            "After the January 6, 2021, insurrection, a bipartisan House majority voted to impeach Donald Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. McConnell knew full well that Trump deserved to be convicted for the high crimes and misdemeanors the 45th president had committed. The Kentuckian effectively acknowledged as much with a speech to the Senate, in which he said: “There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day. The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president. And their having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories, and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth.”",
            "With this understanding, McConnell should have rallied Senate Republicans to vote to hold Trump to account. Had he done so, there’s a good chance that a sufficient number of additional Republicans would have followed their leader in doing the right thing—creating the two-thirds majority that was needed to convict.",
            "But McConnell refused to do the right thing. He voted to acquit, and did more to renew Trump’s political prospects than any other Republican.",
            "McConnell swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For reasons of partisanship and personal political advancement, he abandoned that oath. Nothing more needs to be said of him."

            "[A recent exhibition documenting four centuries of art from female painters and illustrators provides a new way of looking at an era of art history where women are often left out.]",
            "It’s been more than 50 years since Linda Nochlin set the world of art history atremble. In 1971, her provocative essay for Art News, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,” shrewdly answered and deconstructed the seemingly naïve question it posed. For as Nochlin explained, “The question…is simply the top tenth of an iceberg of misinterpretation and misconception; beneath lies a vast dark bulk of shaky idées reçues about the nature of art and its situational concomitants, about the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence in particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this.”",
            "Nochlin’s idea that the social order is what makes great art possible—or not, as the case may be—is as incomplete as it is irrefutable, for it fails to explain why, within a certain social structure that supports or obstructs artistic activity, some people turn out to be much better at it than others. To ascribe it to randomness, some statistical variation, is even less satisfactory than the old idea of genius. Besides, it’s clear, in retrospect, that Nochlin was hardly as free of the stereotype of the “great artist” as she would have liked to be. She explains in detail, for instance, the exclusion of women from the study of the nude—for centuries the very basis for the idea of form in painting, and therefore an exclusion from, as she says, “the necessary preparation for achieving mere proficiency, much less greatness, in the realm of art.” What she doesn’t directly contest is the idea that art—or at least great or “supremely great” art—is the work of a professional painter operating according to the academic standards of the time. By contrast, the “modest, proficient, self-demeaning level of amateurism” demanded of women artists seems to her self-evidently incapable of producing anything of lasting value.",
            "In the wake of Nochlin’s essay, attempts to expand knowledge of women’s contributions to the history of European painting became more numerous. Notable among these, in 1979, was The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work by Germaine Greer—perhaps significantly, not a professional art historian like Nochlin, but an indefatigable researcher: Reviewing Greer’s book, Nochlin found “the sheer volume of examples she presents” an obstacle to its cohesion. Nochlin, in collaboration with Ann Sutherland Harris, organized a large-scale exhibition, “Women Artists: 1550–1950,” which traveled to four American museums from 1976 to ’77; all 37 of the artists included were primarily painters.",
            "Nochlin’s perception, in her 1971 essay, that at least through the mid-20th century, there had been “no supremely great women artists, as far as we know,” but nonetheless “many interesting and very good ones who remain insufficiently investigated or appreciated,” was well supported by these efforts, but the simple question remains: How great is “supremely great”? A few of the women painters of the past are now accorded far higher status than they once were.",
            "It’s true that Caravaggio’s reputation as a revolutionary force in Italian art remains unmatched, but Artemisia Gentileschi now overshadows all the other artists who drew on his influence. Édouard Manet, likewise, may still be seen as the key figure in the emergence of modernism in 19th-century Paris, but among those who recognized and built on his achievement, Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot appear far more important today than they did 50 years ago; the specific qualities of their work, unshared by their contemporaries, have come into focus. Paula Modersohn-Becker outshines most of her German Expressionist colleagues. And while Jackson Pollock remains the Abstract Expressionist par excellence, Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell are now better appreciated than some of the male painters who were once accounted as his near-equals—Franz Kline, for example. Is just plain old “great” not great enough without the “supremely” added like a cherry on top?",
            "I’m as happy as anyone can be for the chance to enjoy the work of a great artist, or a supremely great one, or even just an almost great one. I’m just as grateful to be reminded of how much beauty and pleasure we sometimes overlook in our frantic hunt for the great. Some of that beauty and pleasure has been brought into the world by those “interesting and very good artists” who were hoping to achieve greatness and didn’t quite make it; but much more, perhaps, came from the hands of “modest, proficient” amateurs who never intended to conquer fame but simply to please themselves and the people immediately around them.",
            "That, at least, is my takeaway from “Making Her Mark: A History of Women Artists in Europe, 1400–1800,” which I recently saw at the Baltimore Museum of Art. The show was curated by Andaleeb Badiee Banta, Alexa Greist, and Theresa Kutasz Christensen, and will also be shown in Toronto at the Art Gallery of Ontario from March 30 to July 1. Here, at last, was an exhibition illuminating—more than Nochlin and Harris’s relatively more conventional “Women Artists” exhibition could have done—what Nochlin called “the nature of art and its situational concomitants…the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence in particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this.”",
            "That this would not be a show of “great painting” but something quite different was announced, in a sly way, at the very entrance, where its title and introductory wall text were highlighted by an imposing, elaborately carved wooden frame, more than 10 feet high and six and a half feet wide. This turns out to be the show’s first exhibit: Created in London around 1671, it was meant for a judge’s portrait; the painting no longer exists, but the frame is still here. Its maker was named Mary Ashfield, and she was one of the many women engaged in frame-making in London at the time. She earned £12 for this piece of work, which now lacks its original gilding.",
            "Like this imposing frame, quite a few of the most outstanding things in “Making Her Mark” are marginal to the category of art as conventionally understood but nonetheless the work of highly skilled professionals. Among the show’s most fascinating pieces are its many examples of botanical, zoological, and other types of scientific illustration. These include published engravings, but many of the most striking examples are unique watercolors: for instance, those created by Giovanna Garzoni (who was also a painter of some prominence) in 17th-century Rome, or by Elizabeth Blackwell, who in the 18th century compiled a herbal—in order to pay off her husband’s debts—based on specimens in London’s Chelsea Physic Garden, which is still in existence today. On the basis of her watercolors, Blackwell created the hand-colored engravings and etchings for a book she published in 1739.",
            "Such botanical illustrations demanded great precision and carried a great deal of information about their subjects, but they also offered their makers great scope for invention, and even a kind of disciplined fantasy. Blackwell’s work, in particular, is of a breathtaking delicacy. But more than that, her images practically vibrate with life. Most extraordinary of all, perhaps, is her vision of a yellow asphodel, with its long, slender, sinuously meandering leaves, which look as if they are drifting about languidly in some fluid medium. If you Google this plant today, you might find that it “features a clump of narrow, linear, grassy, gray-green leaves to 12 [inches] tall”—but how drily austere that sounds in comparison to the oddly seductive vision of this plant that Blackwell offers.",
            "Another memorable watercolor of putatively naturalistic purport is one attributed to Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff, a German specialist in botanical illustration who worked in Amsterdam and later moved to the Dutch colony of Surinam. She learned from and collaborated with her mother, Maria Sibylla Merian, who was best known for her illustrations of caterpillars, and with her sister. Seen as a piece of scientific illustration, Herolt-Graff’s Three Mice Nibbling Fruits and Nuts (ca. 1690–1710), presents a quandary: Are the plants the main subject, or the hungry animals? I’d say it’s neither, but rather the at once destructive and sustaining act of eating itself, which in this hyper-real image (almost hallucinatory) appears both sinister and paradisiacal, like some lost detail from Hieronymous Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights.",
            "A step beyond scientific illustration are the uncannily realistic porcelain flowers made, circa 1748, at the Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres in France by an atelier of female ceramicists and painters under the direction of Marie-Henriette Gravant. These minutely detailed little knickknacks were, it seems, a particular delight of the king’s mistress, Madame de Pompadour. From the wall label, we learn that she enjoyed “perfuming them to create the scented illusion of a garden indoors.” Today, without this aroma, they exude a surreal sense of petrified life.",
            "Artists like Blackwell and Herolt-Graff were professionals whose intensity of vision lent their ostensibly pragmatic and utilitarian art a beauty and strangeness unaccounted for by the information it was designed to convey. But there’s also plenty of genteel amateurism on display, which transcended the limited scope of its makers’ ambition. Occasionally, the same person could play both roles. One example is Anna Maria Garthwaite. On the one hand, she was a hugely successful designer of silk textiles in 18th-century London; her opulently rococo art is represented in “Making Her Mark” by watercolors, swatches of fabric, and full garments. But her most striking work in the show was unrelated to this profession. It was something that must have been done as a hobby: an intricate but folksy silhouette image in black paper, showing—as it was described when auctioned at Christie’s in London in 1993 (it now belongs to the Victoria and Albert Museum)—“an English manor house, within fenced gardens and extensive woodland landscape, with gardeners, huntsmen, horses and carriages, deer and hounds, a church and village to the west of the house.” All that, in a finely cut sheet not much more than 15 inches across, in a naïvely geometrical style that couldn’t be further from the rich floral curves of Garthwaite’s textile design patterns. Whatever her reason for creating this piece, it was very distinct from her commercial endeavors.",
            "In spirit, Garthwaite’s silhouette is closer to the flat, highly patterned representations found in many embroideries, samplers, and other examples of craftwork that were considered suitable pastimes for virtuous women and girls. Take a work bag made in Britain in 1669 by a 10-year-old with the initials I.S., a marvel of patience as well as of fine stitchery. Also presumably the work of a devoted amateur is an amazingly elaborate piece of quillwork—filigree made of rolled paper—made in the 18th century, though who knows where or by whom. It’s essentially a ridiculously ornate frame, about 11 by 14 inches, for a tiny picture (a disc of about an inch and a half in width) of the Madonna and Child. Quillwork, we are told, was considered “an affordable way to decorate everything from reliquaries to furniture, altarpieces, and small works for both personal devotion and domestic decoration, like this example.” And while it may have been materially inexpensive, how dear must have been the time spent on it!",
            "But with this anonymous piece, I find myself back at my starting point: a frame becoming more important than the painting it’s meant to set off or supplement. It thus evokes, like it or not, the philosopher Jacques Derrida’s famous paradox of the parergon, the framing or supplement that is purported to be secondary to the artwork itself but turns out to be essential. Need it be pointed out that this accords with the position of women in relation to art, at least during the period covered by “Making Her Mark”? At best, somewhere on the edge of art, somewhere around it but not quite in it—involved in an activity with a certain similarity to art but either too personal, too amateur, or else too much of a business enterprise, never quite properly artistic.",
            "That’s not to say, of course, that the exhibition does not also include its fair share of things that are unmistakably high art, above all history paintings like the two interpretations of a biblical story that one might, if one wished, take as an allegory for woman’s revenge on her male oppressor: Judith with the head of Holofernes. As painted in 1596 by the Milanese artist Fede Galizia, Judith exhibits a strange serenity beside her decapitated Assyrian foe. But her elderly maid looks on with an expression of perplexity, and the composition creates an ambiguity about the three hands that surround the severed head and the platter below: the hand cradling the tray must be the servant’s, the hand holding the head by its hair ought to be Judith’s, and yet it never becomes quite possible to see it that way without forcing oneself, imposing narrative logic on a recalcitrant visual puzzle. Artemisia Gentileschi’s version, painted around 1623–25, is an altogether more dramatic—and dramatically lit—composition. But this Judith doesn’t bother with the head she’s just severed; with a strange gesture toward the single candle illuminating the scene, she seems to hush its light, while leaving the cleanup to the ever-dependable maid.",
            "Just as the frame can overpower the painting, “Making Her Mark” turns the tables on a few centuries’ worth of established artistic hierarchies, fulfilling Nochlin’s call for equality in a way that Nochlin herself—because she could not question the idea of “that total inner confidence, that absolute certitude and self-determination, moral and esthetic, demanded by the highest and most innovative work in art”—could not succeed in doing. In that sense, the exhibition represents a late (albeit not a moment too soon) consequence of the great wave of second-generation feminism. But it’s not only Nochlin’s (and Greer’s, and so many others’) determination to recover the memory of so much silenced effort by so many women that has finally made such an exhibition possible. It’s also reflective of a broader shift in our sense of what the very word “art” means.",
            "That shift was certainly caused, in part, by that same second-wave feminism, which generated a passionate interest in forms of creativity that had previously been deemed sub-artistic, categorized as craft rather than art, and often practiced by women. It was also a product of the rise, starting in the late 1960s, of what can now be called conceptual art: a new way of looking at things according to which, at least under certain circumstances, functional everyday objects, images meant to convey empirical information rather than aesthetic feeling, and images that reiterate already existing imagery (like the many works in the show based on drawing exercises and textile pattern books) can have the same artistic status as unique paintings and sculptures. Think of Lorraine O’Grady’s 1983 work Art Is…, in which performers framed the spectators of an African American Day Parade on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard in Harlem, turning everyone into an embodiment of art. It’s this expansion of the possible range of reference of the word “art” that helps make it possible to see today the artistic value of china plates, lace, and so many of the other objects in this exhibition.",
            "In the catalog for “Making Her Mark,” its project is described—in implicit contrast to Nochlin’s accent on the “supremely great”—as a search for “the unexceptional woman artist.” I think that might be misguided. I’m not sure art of any sort can be made in the absence of an impulse to be exceptional—and this exhibition proves it. For some, the arena in which one strives to achieve distinction may be, as it was for Gentileschi, the apex of European society, or it might be a small circle of intimates. As we all know, time has a way of leveling those differences. May the leveling continue."

            "[For the fourth time since January, Congress is facing a deadline to fund essential spending priorities. The House GOP has neither shame nor sense of responsibility.]",
            "Welcome back, my friends, to the shit show that never ends. For the fourth time in its brief tenure, the 118th Congress is on the brink of a government shutdown, with a fifth deadline to fund essential spending priorities just a week behind this Saturday’s cutoff date. (This tally doesn’t even count the near-death debt-ceiling deal last spring—the accord that set former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on a path to dismissal at the hands of eight professionally outraged hard-right members.)",
            "When McCarthy’s eventual successor, Mike Johnson, cut his own deal to approve a continuing resolution to avert a shutdown in January, he tried to tamp down a brewing revolt among the members of the anti-government Freedom Caucus with a bit of scheduling legerdemain. In lieu of using a big deadline to produce an ungainly omnibus deal to keep the government funded, Johnson proudly debuted a two-tiered spending deadline. The first tranche of funding bills—enabling the continued operations of the departments of Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, Housing, and Transportation—would need to secure passage in the House by March 1. The next batch of spending bills, slated to expire March 8, pay for everything else, namely the departments of Justice, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, State, Education, Interior, and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the legislative branch.",
            "With a straight face, Johnson proclaimed that this staggered approach to the main business of the House—minding the government’s purse strings—would permit his fractious conference, operating with a razor-thin majority, to better advance and secure its legislative priorities. “We’re not surrendering, we’re fighting,” the new speaker said at the time. “But you have to be wise about choosing your fights.”",
            "Now, Johnson’s self-touted wisdom is bearing fruit—with the same desperate rush to avert a shutdown that provoked the January deal. The GOP House conference, already boasting historic levels of legislative inactivity, confronted Saturday’s shutdown deadline with the sage circumspection that it’s displayed since the new majority was seated last January: It took an extended recess and returned with no coherent plan of action. So Johnson once again faces the least palatable option for the survival of his speakership: obtaining a rules suspension to broker a spending deal that relies on Democratic support to get passed.",
            "“What’s stunning to me is that you’ve got the shutdown deadline, and you’ve got Ukraine funding, funding for Israel and the border and Taiwan,” Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress watcher and emeritus fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told me. “You have all these critical issues, but Republicans take longer recesses than usual.” This dilatory approach to the GOP’s self-imposed deadline, combined with the power dynamics under a shrinking House majority, leave Johnson in a tighter spot to produce results than he was in during the January spending wars. “If they fuck this up and can’t make it work, and Johnson somehow brings a plan up under suspension, this is one where you’re going to need a substantial number of Republicans on board,” Ornstein said. “If you’re looking at the [supplemental] funding bill for Ukraine and Israel, you’re going to lose some Democrats because of Israel funding, so you’ll need a significant number of Republicans.”",
            "It’s also an election year, which makes it especially difficult for Republican lawmakers to make the case to hold on to and expand their House majority, or christen a new Senate one, when they’ve throttled basic government services—on top of their leadership battles and operatic culture-war inquisitions. That’s why Johnson’s Senate counterpart Mitch McConnell is already lobbying him to avert a shutdown: McConnell knows that, even with a 2024 map that favors a GOP Senate majority, pulling the plug on federal services could lead to electoral disaster. That’s the unmistakable lesson of past GOP-engineered shutdowns, from the 1995–96 Gingrich-authored debacle to Donald Trump’s border-wall fiasco of 2018.",
            "Johnson has conducted a frantic round of meetings with Senate leaders and President Joe Biden trying to forestall a partial shutdown by the end of the week. In his most recent White House confab with Biden, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, Johnson met the Democrats’ pleas to approve Ukraine funding with a renewed push to move forward on border security—even though the Senate-brokered bill on the issue has been denied a floor vote at the behest of Johnson’s chief political retainer, former president Donald Trump. Johnson, in other words, is not merely content with repeating the Beckett-style negotiations over a shutdown on autoplay; he’s going out of his way to draw attention to the greatest, self-inflicted legislative cock-up of the 118th Congress. This really says everything about today’s class of Republican lawmakers: Even as they reckon with preordained policy doom, they’re unable to come up with any fresh material. “It’s such an embarrassment to any concept of responsibility, of following the oath they all took, of running a critical institution,” Ornstein said. “And that they have no shame about it, that just compounds everything.”"

            "[The “Uncommitted” vote was a measure of frustration with Biden’s stance on Gaza, and it was up dramatically from past primaries.]",
            "The last time an incumbent Democratic president ran in a Michigan presidential primary, 20,833 Democrats voted “Uncommitted.”",
            "That was in 2012, when President Barack Obama secured 90 percent of the vote in a low-turnout primary. Obama went on to carry the battleground state with relative ease in November.",
            "This year, President Joe Biden was hoping for a similar show of support from all the constituencies that form the Democratic base in Michigan, a battleground state he desperately needs to win in what’s shaping up as a close November contest with Republican former president Donald Trump. That’s one of the reasons the Biden team and its allies at the Democratic National Committee moved Michigan’s primary to a position near the start of the 2024 nominating process. But on Tuesday night, primary voters in Michigan sent a very different message than the one the president was looking for. More than 100,000 of them checked the “Uncommitted” box—five times as many as did so in 2012.",
            "As of early Wednesday morning, with 95 percent of the total counted, Biden had received just over 81 percent of the vote, while 13.3 percent chose the “Uncommitted” option on the Michigan ballot. The remaining votes went to author and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, who has suspended her 2024 bid, and US Representative Dean Phillips (D-Mich.).",
            "It’s no secret why “Uncommitted” performed so strongly. The protest vote offered an opportunity to express outrage over Biden’s hands-off approach to Israel’s assault on Gaza. That military offensive, launched after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has left almost 30,000 Palestinian civilians dead. More than 12,000 of the casualties are children.",
            "Biden has been warned for months, by critics and allies, that his unstinting support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war would put his campaign in peril. With Tuesday’s vote, which came at a point when the president and his aides say they are working to ease the violence in Gaza but have yet to achieve anything akin to an agreement for a permanent cease-fire, a substantial portion of Michigan Democrats showed him that they weren’t bluffing. Their message was blunt: Biden’s presidency could hang in the balance if he doesn’t pay attention to voters he needs in November.",
            "“Every person who voted ‘Uncommitted’ today was personally compelled to use their voice to speak out against President Biden’s support of Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people,” said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, a heavily Democratic city of almost 110,000 that is home to the largest Muslim population, per capita, in the United States—and where the “Uncommitted” option was beating Biden by a 56-40 margin. “Today, thousands said, ‘Enough’. As American citizens and Michigan voters, we have made our voices heard at the ballot box. Now, it is up to President Biden to listen to Michigan and do the right thing.”",
            "The “right thing” was defined during the primary campaign by the “Listen to Michigan” movement, which was organized just three weeks ago to urge voters who are angry with Biden’s Gaza stance to cast “Uncommitted” ballots in order to deliver a message to the president. The campaign, which drew support from US Representative Rashida Tlaib and dozens of elected Democrats, as well as activist groups and Detroit’s Metro Times, focused on a pair of fundamental themes: the moral necessity for Biden and his foreign policy team to support an immediate and permanent cease-fire in order to stop the killing in Gaza; and the political necessity for Biden and his reelection campaign to recognize that Arab American voters, Muslim voters, young voters, and a substantial number of Black voters want a new direction when it comes to US policies regarding Israel and Palestine. All of those constituencies are key to Democratic prospects in Michigan, a swing state, where Biden trails Trump in most recent polls.",
            "Michigan has for many years been one of America’s most closely contested battleground states. In 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton struggled to mobilize party constituencies, she lost Michigan to Trump by a little more than 10,000 votes, for a 0.23 percent margin. Four years later, when Biden maximized his appeal to the party base, the Democrat beat the Republican by roughly 155,000 votes, for a 2.78 percent margin.",
            "This year, says former US representative Andy Levin (D-Mich.), “I don’t think that Joe Biden can win the presidency without winning Michigan, and I don’t think that he can win Michigan without a change of course on Gaza.”",
            "Levin is not alone in arguing that if Biden hopes to carry Michigan in November, he must recognize that he’s got a political problem in the state, and that this problem is rooted in anger over his Gaza stance among precisely the voters that he needs to win. Those voters are in places like Wayne County—with its large Arab American communities in Dearborn and Hamtramck, and its large Black population in Detroit and other communities—and Washtenaw County, a liberal stronghold where the Democratic vote is powered by student turnout at the University of Michigan campus at Ann Arbor and Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. Those counties registered some of the highest levels of frustration with Biden on Tuesday, as more than 17 percent of voters in Wayne and Washtenaw cast “Uncommitted” ballots.",
            "Among Muslim voters, the numbers were most dramatic. An exit poll conducted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and its Michigan chapter, suggested that over 90 percent of Michigan Muslims who were contacted for the survey had voted “Uncommitted.”",
            "“What we know is this: Michigan is going to be a significant state in November, and there are a significant number of pro-peace, anti-war voters in Michigan,” explained Michigan State House majority leader Abraham Aiyash, a Democrat who said that, while “Donald Trump is by far the worst and most reckless candidate running for president,” many Michiganders believe that “Joe Biden hasn’t done enough to stop the mass slaughter and suffering of the Palestinians. We can and will demand more from the president.”",
            "Aiyash says Michigan Democrats will take that demand to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this summer, where they will push not just for a permanent cease-fire but for cutting US military aid to Israel. If Biden and the Democrats do not respond, suggests Aiyash, they risk the prospect of losing both Michigan and the presidency.",
            "Michigan’s volatility has made it an essential swing state for many years. But it could be even more critical in 2024. That’s because several states that Biden carried in 2020, including Georgia and Nevada, could be harder to win this year. So the president needs Michigan. Yet the “Uncommitted” vote of Tuesday signals that he has a lot of work to do if he hopes to unite and turn out the whole of the Democratic base.",
            "James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab-American Institute, and a longtime member of the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee, summed up the message from Michigan on Tuesday warning Biden, “Read the room…. Change policy & promote justice for Palestinians—or risk losing.”"

            "[Following Washington’s lead, key US allies have cut funding for the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestine—making them all complicit in genocide.]",
            "When the 17 judges of the International Court of Justice issued their near-unanimous ruling on January 26, making clear that Israel’s actions in Gaza plausibly constituted genocide, they asserted the legitimacy of the world’s most influential judicial body to hold Israel provisionally accountable for those violations.",
            "Israel was having none of it.",
            "Just hours after the court’s decision was announced in The Hague, Israel went public with an unsubstantiated allegation that 12 Gazan employees of the UN’s Relief Works Agency, the primary body responsible for providing humanitarian support to Palestine refugees, supposedly were tied to Hamas and may have played some role in the attack on Israel on October 7. (In fact, the names of all UNRWA employees had been provided to Israel earlier in the year for Tel Aviv’s vetting—and Israel made no complaints.) Despite the lack of evidence, UNRWA—presumably in an effort to avoid a dangerous collective punishment by Israel’s allies—immediately announced that it was firing the named employees (two were confirmed dead) and the UN launched two separate investigations.",
            "Not wanting to wait a moment, however, Washington announced on the same day that it was cutting its entire aid allocation to UNRWA, despite the agency’s irreplaceable role in getting desperately needed aid into Gaza. A few hours later, key US allies announced that they were joining Washington in cutting aid: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and new NATO-member Finland. The United States provides by far the largest annual donation available to the UN agency (although, at just over $300 million, it’s a pittance compared to the almost $4 billion the US sends to the Israeli military every year). And combined with the at least 15 countries that eventually joined the US cuts, the impact on UNRWA’s ability to provide even the most minimal of basic services is enormous. With those services destroyed by Israel’s war, this US role in further undermining Palestinians’ access to water, food, medicine, shelter, and fuel makes Washington—again —directly complicit in Israel’s genocide.",
            "Then things got worse. Two weeks later, on February 9, Israel launched another PR attack on UNRWA, this time claiming that a tunnel under the agency’s headquarters in Gaza City had been used by Hamas—variously identified as a communications center, a command center or a data center. Again no evidence was made public, but, among other responses, the US Senate bill authorizing $14 billion for unconditional aid to the Israeli military stated explicitly that none of the bill’s separate humanitarian aid (for conflict zones around the world) could go to UNRWA. US officials themselves had argued earlier that UNRWA was “the only game in town” in terms of getting any significant aid into Gaza, but the bill still imposed a permanent ban on US funding. (If passed by the House, it would even prevent UNRWA from receiving a tiny $300,000 grant that had already been approved.)",
            "The impact of the aid cuts on the already threatened lives of 2.3 million displaced Gazans, as well as millions more Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, can hardly be overstated. US officials who suggested redirection of UNRWA funds to UNICEF and the World Food Program only showed their ignorance of conditions on the ground, and the capacities of aid organizations. UNICEF and WFP together have less than 70 staff on the ground in Gaza; UNRWA has over 13,000 providing, for more than half a century, all the services that ordinarily would be provided by a government civil service. Most of Gaza’s doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, street sweepers are UNRWA employees. Without UNRWA, all the UN agencies and NGOs would be unable to carry out their crucial work. Thousands, probably tens of thousands more civilians—especially babies, children, pregnant women, and the elderly—will die.",
            "And there is another price to be paid as well. Along with its critical role in lifesaving humanitarian assistance, UNRWA remains the only international agency in the UN system whose mandate includes protection of the rights of Palestinians as refugees. The work of UNRWA, from its creation in 1949, was designed to continue until Palestinian refugees achieved “a just and durable solution to their plight” on the basis of all the human rights and refugee rights to which they are entitled.",
            "That means that UNRWA’s work is unfinished until the Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes, guaranteed by international law, is made real. Refugees—dispossessed in 1948 of their homes and land from what is now southern Israel—make up 70 percent of Gaza’s population. Without UNRWA, their right of return, indeed the very existence of Palestinians as a refugee community, is threatened with erasure. And that—creating conditions that make the survival of all or part of a threatened group as a group impossible—is part of the very definition of genocide.",
            "No wonder Israel is so eager to get rid of UNRWA. And for the same reason, no wonder the defense of UNRWA remains such a critical factor in our continuing work for an immediate cease-fire and Palestinian access to unhindered humanitarian assistance in Gaza."

            "[Crystal Clanton became notorious for sending outlandishly racist texts. Now she’s been hired to work for the Justice—and a dubious new story has surfaced to clear her name.]",
            "Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas shocked the legal community when the news broke that one of his new law clerks will be Crystal Clanton—who became notorious in 2015 for apparently sending texts that said, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all . . . I hate blacks. End of story.” For most young lawyers, sending such a text would indeed have been the “end of story.” Instead, Clanton is on the cusp of clinching one of the most coveted prizes in the American legal system. In the past several years, as Clanton has risen through the ranks of conservative legal circles, the story of her alleged racist outburst has been curiously transformed into a tale of victimhood. The new narrative is that Clanton was somehow framed by an unnamed enemy who—for motives that remain unclear—fabricated the racist texts to defame her.",
            "This new account has been greeted with suspicion by many. If the revised story is a lie, then it threatens to implicate not just Justice Thomas, who has endorsed it, but several lower-court federal judges and the leader of a major political group aligned with former President Donald Trump. Indeed, the whole affair may prove one of the most shopworn axioms of political reporting—that the coverup is worse than the crime.",
            "When the vile texts were sent, Clanton was the second-in-command and field director of the hard-right youth group Turning Point USA. The organization, a nonprofit advocacy group closely allied with Donald Trump’s Presidential aspirations in 2024, is well known for poisonous rhetoric: its leader, Charlie Kirk, has recently denigrated Martin Luther King, Jr., as “awful,” questioned whether Black pilots are capable of flying planes, and argued that televised public executions, perhaps by guillotine, should be held in America, with young people watching. Yet, even within Turning Point, colleagues were so shocked by the bluntness of Clanton’s alleged texts that they preserved screenshots of the messages, which were shared in 2017 with The New Yorker. At the time, multiple Turning Point employees told me that Clanton was the author of the messages.",
            "In 2017, Clanton told me, via e-mail, that she didn’t recall sending the texts, and that they seemed out of character. But when she was asked directly if she denied sending them she declined to answer. The screenshots of the messages bore her cell-phone number. Another former Turning Point employee, John Ryan O’Rourke, who was the recipient of the texts, said at the time that he preferred not to discuss them. Several other Turning Point colleagues had also seen and circulated the screenshots. And there was more evidence. In addition to the racist comments, the screenshots show Clanton asking, “Can I come to Starbucks in 5?”; she showed up at one, on cue, a few minutes later. (In 2018, the online platform Mediaite revealed another offensive statement by Clanton, sent on Snapchat. The post featured a photograph of a man who appeared to be Arab, accompanied by a caption that she had added: “Just thinking about ways to do another 9/11.”)",
            "In 2017, Clanton told me that she had resigned from Turning Point. Kirk, her boss at the time, made her departure sound less voluntary. In an e-mail, he told me that, after he learned of the texts, “Turning Point assessed the situation and took decisive action within 72 hours.” Four years later, a spokesman for Turning Point, Andrew Kolvet, confirmed the same set of facts to Ruth Marcus, a columnist for the Washington Post, telling her that Clanton was “terminated from Turning Point after the discovery of problematic texts.”",
            "The story would likely be long forgotten, were it not for an extremely strange plot twist. After the texting scandal, Ginni Thomas, the lobbyist and politically active wife of Clarence Thomas, who had worked closely with Clanton as an adviser to Turning Point, unofficially adopted Clanton as the couple’s protégée. The Thomases harbor deep anger at the mainstream media, stemming in part from the Justice’s embattled 1991 confirmation hearing, and evidently saw in Clanton a fellow-victim. Soon after leaving Turning Point, Clanton started working for Ginni Thomas. Remarkably, the Thomases then invited Clanton to live with them at their home in exurban Virginia, for the better part of the next year. The couple encouraged Clanton to go to law school, and Justice Thomas himself recommended her when she successfully applied to the Antonin Scalia Law School, at George Mason University. Justice Thomas also helped Clanton, who graduated in 2022, line up a prestigious judicial clerkship with Chief Judge William H. Pryor, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Pryor is one of the most conservative members of the federal bench, and a well-known “feeder” of clerks to Justice Thomas’s chambers.",
            "Supreme Court clerkships, which last for a year, are extremely valuable in both professional and financial terms. It’s common for former clerks to receive half-a-million-dollar bonuses when they sign on for their first law-firm jobs, and the credential eases the path to coveted academic and political positions. An extraordinary number of Thomas clerks—twenty-two, according to the Associated Press in 2018—populated the high ranks of the Trump Administration or were nominated by Trump for judgeships; others have fanned out across the nation to other prominent posts.",
            "Ordinarily, only the very best law students in the country, with the most impeccable résumés, get a shot at a Supreme Court clerkship. Presumably, a past that included termination for making grotesquely racist statements would present an obstacle. But Ginni Thomas’s intense enthusiasm for Clanton became evident in a leaked video of a 2019 closed-door session of the secretive Council for National Policy, a conservative leadership group to which both Ginni Thomas and Charlie Kirk belong. The video shows her introducing Clanton to the members as her special guest, and saying, “Crystal was for five years Charlie’s right-hand person, the wind in his sails, from a garage organization to this organization. And now she’s the wind in my sails.”",
            "In one sense, it hardly matters whom Justice Thomas hires as a law clerk. His conservative judicial views are well known and unwavering, and it’s improbable that one of his clerks would bend his decisions in any discernible way. Also, had Clanton apologized, it’s unlikely that many people would still care. But hiring a young woman who was fired for racial bigotry, and who has never apologized for it, could scarcely send a worse message to Black litigants and lawyers, or do more to undermine the Court’s promise—carved into its building’s grand façade—to deliver “Equal Justice Under Law.”",
            "Perhaps even more disturbing than Clanton’s hiring is the dubious revisionist history that has emerged to justify her selection. This refashioned narrative threatens to implicate the credibility of some of the most powerful legal officials in the country.",
            "In the fall of 2021, reports surfaced that Clanton had lined up two successive clerkships: the first with U.S. District Court Judge Corey Maze, of the Northern District of Alabama, and the second with Judge Pryor, of the Eleventh Circuit. Ruth Marcus, the Washington Post opinion writer, posted a column asking of Pryor, “Why is a prominent federal judge hiring a law clerk who said she hates Black people?” Democrats on Capitol Hill filed an ethics complaint with the Eleventh Circuit, complaining that Maze and Pryor had hired “an individual with a history of nakedly racist and hateful conduct.” They warned that placing such a person in “close proximity to judicial decision-making threatens to seriously undermine the public’s faith” in the federal courts. And they argued that no member of any minority would “trust that they will receive equal justice before these judges.”",
            "The federal judiciary’s self-policing process is abstruse enough to delight fans of “Bleak House.” The complaint was transferred to the Second Circuit, in New York, where Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston, an appointee of George W. Bush, began an inquiry. The confidential process took place behind closed doors, but Bill Rankin, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, obtained letters that Justice Thomas and Judge Pryor sent to the Second Circuit in support of Clanton. Justice Thomas wrote that his wife had “informed me of the horrible way” Clanton “had been treated at Turning Point and asked that she be allowed to live with us.” The implication was that Clanton had been victimized at Turning Point.",
            "Pryor added more detail. He put forward a novel defense of Clanton, which he attributed to conversations he’d had with Justice Thomas, along with a previously unmentioned set of facts provided by Charlie Kirk. According to this new account, Clanton was actually the victim of an unidentified former employee, who, for unknown reasons, had framed her as the author of the racist texts. It was not explained why this outlandishly devious plot hadn’t been exposed earlier—not at the time of her resignation, nor when Clanton was interviewed by The New Yorker, nor during the subsequent four years, when Turning Point’s spokesman consistently confirmed that Clanton had been fired for sending the texts.",
            "According to Pryor’s letter, Clanton had been unable to deny the allegations about the racist texts earlier because she had been bound by a nondisclosure agreement, the existence of which she evidently had failed to mention to reporters at the time. If there was an N.D.A., Clanton also didn’t mention it to a lawyer to whom she referred my questions in 2017. The lawyer, Robert Grabemann, told me that he hadn’t prepared an N.D.A. for her and wasn’t aware that one existed. Stephen Gillers, a law professor at N.Y.U. who is considered a leading authority on questions of judicial ethics, said the claim that an N.D.A. prevented Clanton from telling the truth earlier “is simply not credible,” adding, “I’ve seen my share of N.D.A.s, and I can’t imagine one that would forbid a person to deny making racist statements. I don’t know how one might even word such an N.D.A. To me, this claim is preposterous and strong evidence that information needed for public understanding of these events has been hidden.”",
            "In Pryor’s letter, he said Justice Thomas had assured him that Clanton “was a victim of a pernicious attempt to portray her as a racist.” Kirk, meanwhile, had told Pryor “the media has alleged that Crystal said and did things that are simply untrue.” Instead, Kirk claimed, the real culprit was a former employee who had “created fake text messages to be used against other employees,” in order to make it seem as though they had engaged in misconduct. The real culprit’s name was not identified.",
            "Clanton did not respond to a request for comment. When I reached Kirk to ask him to explain his volte-face on Clanton’s responsibility for the texts, he referred me to his spokesman, who said that he had no comment on the veracity of the new version of the facts, even though it contradicted the explanation that he had provided before. Moreover, when I checked this new account with former Turning Point employees, they hadn’t heard anything about faked texts, or were aware of any other employee having been held responsible for the elaborate ruse. And when Marcus, at the Washington Post, inquired about the new origin story for the texts, a former Turning Point staffer simply replied, “Not fake,” and declined to say more. In a column, Marcus, a graduate of Harvard Law School, deemed the revisionist narrative “not credible.”",
            "Nonetheless, Judge Livingston seemed satisfied. Without obtaining the disputed texts or interviewing key witnesses, she dismissed the ethics complaint against Judge Pryor and Judge Maze. In her ruling, Livingston echoed the claim that the original news coverage was false, and that Clanton had always treated everyone with “kindness, respect and fairness.” She wrote that a Turning Point executive—clearly Kirk—had explained that a different employee “was fired after the organization learned that this person had created fake text messages to be used against coworkers, to make it appear they had engaged in misconduct, when they had not.” Livingston noted that Clanton was highly qualified, and that Pryor and Maze knew about the allegations against Clanton before offering her the coveted clerkships, and that both had determined the allegations of racist behavior by Clanton to be untrue. The “undisputed record,” Livingston concluded, shows that Pryor and Maze “performed all the due diligence that a responsible Judge would undertake.”",
            "Critics howled. Congressman Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia on the House Judiciary Committee, who helped initiate the ethics complaint, declared that “the 2nd Circuit’s decision does a disservice to everyone involved,” adding, “This cannot be the end of the matter.” (When I reached out to Livingston, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts replied that misconduct proceedings are “confidential by statute. So Chief Judge Livingston cannot comment.”)",
            "There was one final attempt to get to the bottom of the allegations. The Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee of the U.S. Judicial Conference asked a special committee to gather more evidence. The committee told the Second Circuit that it needed to go back and find out whether Clanton had, in fact, made the racist statements attributed to her, and exactly what Clanton had told Pryor and Maze about the matter. It pointed out that Clanton “has never publicly denied the allegations,” and noted that “there are numerous individuals with first-hand knowledge of the candidate’s alleged conduct.” At a minimum, it said, “the special committee should attempt to interview the candidate and the witnesses identified in the media reports we have cited.”",
            "But that didn’t happen. Instead, Judge Pryor and Judge Maze invoked a legal rule to bar the Judicial Conference from reopening Livingston’s findings. Jeremy Fogel, the director of the Berkeley Judicial Institute and a retired federal judge, told me, in an e-mail, that those who support Justice Thomas’s outlook “likely will argue that this decision clearly is within his discretion as a justice, especially given the close working relationship and level of trust expected between justices and their law clerks.” His critics, however, “will see this as another example of his willingness to ignore ethical rules.” (Justice Thomas and Ginni Thomas declined to comment for this story, as did Judge Maze. Judge Pryor did not respond to a request for comment.)",
            "Either way, with the help of some rather powerful patrons, and a weak judicial-ethics system, Crystal Clanton is on her way to clerk at the highest court in the land. Eric Segall, a law professor at the Georgia State University College of Law, who served in George H. W. Bush’s Justice Department, told me, “Can you imagine what would happen if a Black person who said ‘I hate all white people’ ended up clerking for Sotomayor? You’d never hear the end of it on Fox News. But there’s almost total silence about this.” ♦"

            "[The drag star brought the form mainstream, and made an empire out of queer expression. Now he fears “the absolute worst.”]",
            "Recently, the drag star RuPaul Andre Charles has taken to falling asleep while watching the documentary series “Secrets of Great British Castles.” He’s seen every episode, knows every turn in the bloody histories of landmarks like Dover Castle and the Tower of London. “The headline is: Humans have been horrible since the beginning of time,” RuPaul told me. “And the human ego can justify these terrible things that people do. You know, these kings, Henry VIII, and Edward II, and all these people who have just decimated hundreds of thousands of people because their feelings were hurt.”",
            "RuPaul is braced for conflict. “I’m fearing the absolute worst,” he said. “We are moments away from fucking civil war. All the signs are there.” He continued, “Humans on this planet are in the cycle of destruction. I am plotting a safety net.” He was referring to a fortified compound being constructed on the sixty-thousand-acre ranch of his husband, Georges LeBar, in Wyoming. “I wouldn’t call it a bunker,” he said. But it is designed to withstand calamity. “It’s a lot of concrete and a lot of things. I keep thinking about these castles that I’m going to bed to.”",

He was shooting “RuPaul’s Drag Race UK,” one of nineteen regional variations of his competition reality show, while promoting a memoir, which will be published this week, called “The House of Hidden Meanings.” (The title comes from a friend’s comment during an acid trip. “After the drugs wore off,” he writes, “I realized it was nonsense.”) RuPaul now hosts seven versions of “Drag Race,” a pastiche of competition reality-television tropes that follows participants, in and out of drag, through eclectic challenges including costume-making, lip-synching, and standup comedy (testing “charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent”—the resulting acronym is representative of the show’s bawdy sense of humor). He has taken an underground, subversive form and made it so mainstream that Nancy Pelosi has appeared as a guest on the show. The sixteenth season of the U.S. version, currently airing, has some of its highest ratings yet, and RuPaul recently won his fourteenth Emmy, making him the most decorated competition host and the most decorated person of color in the award’s history.",
            "“Drag Race” often focusses on competitors who are profoundly marginalized. Almost all the drag queens on the show are queer, and many are people of color, who come from backgrounds where they faced homophobia, racism, or transphobia. For them, drag can be a lifeline, affording a sense of community and an opportunity to transmute stigmatized traits into something exuberant. “It’s armor, ’cause you’re putting on a persona. So the comments are hitting something you created, not you,” Jinkx Monsoon, who has won two seasons of the show, told me. “And then it’s my sword, because all of the things that made me a target make me powerful as a drag queen.”",
            "Yet, as “Drag Race” has become mainstream, a burgeoning culture war has demonized its subject matter. In the past year, lawmakers in at least fifteen states have attempted to ban drag shows, part of a wider queer panic. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, more than four hundred bills that the organization identifies as anti-L.G.B.T.Q.+ are currently under consideration around the country, featuring provisions like curriculum censorship, facilities bans, and mandates that school staff out young people to their families. Drag performances, particularly for child audiences, have recently been cancelled in at least seven countries where “Drag Race” airs. RuPaul, sixty-three, is the world’s most famous drag queen, at the helm of one of the world’s most far-reaching platforms for queer expression. In conservative communities around the country and the world, he often serves as a way in to queer culture. And, for those set against that culture, he represents the dangerous spread of liberal ideas. “He’s seen the way people connect to the show. That’s the way for him to spread the rebuttal to what’s happening in the world,” Randy Barbato, an executive producer of “Drag Race,” said. “His way to ward off the enemy.”",
            "One of RuPaul’s favorite responses, to anyone who asks how he’s doing, is “I don’t see how that’s any of your business.” This is a bit, but it’s also something of a life philosophy. “Ru, he is a study in the private and the public self,” Barbato said. “He’s a public figure. And he’s extraordinarily private.” I have twice appeared as a judge on the American “Drag Race” programs, but our interviews in England were our first substantive exchanges. In advance, I received anxious calls from mutual friends telling me how much RuPaul hates giving interviews, and when I met him, at Pinewood Studios, almost the first thing out of his mouth was “I fucking hate giving interviews.” (The actual first thing he said, after he noticed that I was on crutches, owing to a sprained ankle, was classic “Drag Race” standup: “Fisting accident?” Quoting a contestant on the show, I told him, “There are no accidents in fisting.”)",
            "We sat in a small dressing room dominated by RuPaul’s hair-and-makeup collection, which covered four plastic picnic tables, and by the man himself, who is six-four but is often thought to be taller, probably on account of all the killer heels. (The celebrated drag queen Lady Bunny once described him as “a six-foot-seven monster-model-woman thing.”) RuPaul, on a break between shooting segments in which he would appear out of drag, was without the heels, and instead wore fuzzy gray slippers, a black Abbey Road hoodie, and black workout pants. “I did not think this memoir shit through,” he told me, shaking his head. “It’s presumptuous that the interviewer can interpret my experience.” There’s some irony in this: like many reality shows, “Drag Race” is subject to complaints from competitors who feel unfairly reduced to archetypes. (“It’s nothing like what happened on set,” Phi Phi O’Hara, who was portrayed as hostile toward other contestants, told New York.) RuPaul once recorded a song about the complaints, “Blame It on the Edit,” singing, “You the one who said it, bitch / How you gon’ regret it.” To me, he said, “We’ve had kids come on the show, and we put a camera on them, which can be like a mirror, and they see the reflection of themselves and go, ‘Oh, no, that is not who I am. They must have done something to make me look like that.’ Like Blanche DuBois, they will not see it, then they will fight to the end to say, ‘I was tampered with.’ No, we don’t do that.”",
            "RuPaul’s drag and out-of-drag personas on the show are, essentially, characters. In drag, he’s the candy-colored, Diana-Ross-meets-Bugs-Bunny-meets-Dolly-Parton character he’s built an empire around. (The drag looks featured in each episode take four to six hours to create. His makeup artist, a former contestant named Raven, said, “We do a little brush. We take a break. Coffee talk. O.K., let’s get back to it.”) In the show’s out-of-drag segments, where he introduces challenges or checks in on contestants, offering mentorship and advice, he plays a cheerful, avuncular, professorial type, complete with eyeglasses that he doesn’t really need. Both performances offer touches of ribald humor that pay homage to drag’s more transgressive roots, while sanding off the sharpest of those edges and putting a wholesome face on the form. “I went Disney when I went mainstream,” RuPaul told me. Drag’s evolution from edgy night-club revues to family programming has, predictably, spurred criticism. “What was once counterculture has simply become the Culture,” E. Alex Jung wrote, in New York, in 2019. “This has its benefits: Mainstream consumer culture has gotten a little less straight. But in the process, something—maybe the feeling that this was by us and for us . . . was lost.” RuPaul argued that the full spectrum of drag continues to flourish. The form, he told me, “doesn’t need defending.”",
            "His onscreen personas pull off the trick of revealing—in the show’s monomaniacally branded universe, one would say “ru-vealing”—little about RuPaul himself. Even people who work with him closely can find him distant. His appearances on camera are executed like military strikes; he spends relatively little time with panelists and contestants. “I keep the boundaries,” he said. He mentioned a former colleague who worked with him for decades. “We kept a working relationship, we travelled the world together,” he said. “But sometimes I would hear her talking to a friend, and she’d be talking about her latest boyfriend. She never did that with me, because I’m her boss. And the truth is, I don’t want to hear about it. I don’t care about that shit.”",
            "One of RuPaul’s foundational beliefs is that, as he said, “everybody’s playing a role.” At times, he plays a nurturing one. A staple of “Drag Race” is an interview that finalists have with RuPaul—it is often a “lunch” conducted over a bowl of Tic Tacs—in which they tell him their hopes and fears, and he dispenses therapeutic wisdom. It’s easy to dismiss these exchanges as superficial, but they can be a genuine source of strength for competitors. Jinkx Monsoon recalled that, during their lunch segment, “he was, like, ‘You don’t need to make yourself smaller for other people. . . . And he said that, and it was amazing, because it did make me feel like, Oh, I don’t have to feel guilty for being talented.”",
            "At other times, RuPaul can appear cold, a quality born of painful experience. “So much of our culture today, with young people, is centered around their feelings,” he told me. “Feelings are indicators, they’re not facts.” He went on, “Parents teaching their kids about safe spaces, and ‘I feel uncomfortable’ . . . It’s, like, You know what? The world is not a safe space. You have to find the comfort. It’s mostly uncomfortable.” He told me that he has never wanted children. “I don’t like kids,” he said flatly.",
            "RuPaul was born in San Diego in 1960, the third of four children and the only boy, and brought up in a yellow three-bedroom tract house, one of four models in a housing development called Michelle Manor. According to family lore, before he was born a fortune-teller told his mother, Ernestine, that the baby would be famous. Ernestine introduced him to his aunts by saying, “His name is RuPaul and he’s going to be a star.”",
            "“I was always anointed,” he told me. “I know it sounds obnoxious. But I knew from childhood I was the golden child.” His father, Irving, who worked as an electrician at an aerospace company, was a charming philanderer with a gambling problem. Ernestine, who was of Creole descent, was flinty and aloof, with an immaculate sense of style. Her eviscerating barbs earned her the nickname Mean Miss Charles among the neighborhood kids. “She was a mess,” one of Ru’s older sisters, Renetta, has said, referring to their mother’s temper. “Said what she felt, meant what she said, and you dealt with it.” The parents’ fights could be cataclysmic. At one point, Ernestine poured gasoline over Irving’s convertible, an Oldsmobile Delta 88, and threatened him with a matchbook. RuPaul told me, “They were embroiled in their own two battling nations, and I’m in the middle. So I learned how to be a diplomat and read the situation and go, ‘Oh, can’t say that. How can I say it? I’ll say it like this.’ It’s a dissociative thing that we do to protect ourselves, to not make it personal.”",
            "Irving and Ernestine divorced when RuPaul was seven, and afterward he didn’t see much of his father, whose absence he often describes as a primal trauma. Living with his mother, he witnessed her slide into depression and her sorrow at having allowed herself to be vulnerable enough to be heartbroken—a “softness,” RuPaul writes in “The House of Hidden Meanings,” that she viewed as an “Achilles’ heel.” The complicated and forthright portrayal of her in the book is one of its strongest aspects. “It’s my mother,” he told me, about his own guardedness. “She said I’m way too sensitive. And she was absolutely right. So my job for a lot of time has been to hide the fact that I’m too sensitive.”",
            "Attempting to appeal to his mother, through her often Valium-laced distance, RuPaul would impersonate his favorite divas, wrapping a towel around his head to channel Tina Turner and LaWanda Page, who played Aunt Esther on “Sanford and Son.” (Page later featured on the closest thing RuPaul’s had to a mainstream radio hit, “Supermodel (You Better Work),” from 1992, providing the song’s spoken-word narration about a Black girl escaping from poverty into a life of glamour.) Performance soon became a kind of protection. “I never fit in,” he said. “I wasn’t one of the most desired things on the hit list.” Television offered an escape, and early affirmation of his belief that everyone, everywhere, was playing a character. He liked “Mission: Impossible,” with its complex nesting of disguises, each a layer of defense.",
            "In 1976, when RuPaul was fifteen, he moved to Atlanta with Renetta, who was in her early twenties. They were part of a wave of Black newcomers seeking economic opportunity. He enrolled at the Northside School of Performing Arts, where he appeared in drag for the first time onstage, in the Tennessee Williams play “Camino Real.” After dropping out, he came into contact with the drag scene at a disco called Numbers, where he watched a queen named Crystal LaBeija lip-synch to Donna Summer’s “Bad Girls.” By the eighties, Atlanta was “drag heaven,” Lady Bunny told The New Yorker, in 1993. “Midtown Atlanta was a very gay scene. They had transvestite hookers all over the streets day and night. When we started out, the Southern queens were deadly serious, without a shred of humor.” But RuPaul embraced a genre of drag now known as “genderfuck,” a catchall term for aesthetics that are designed to poke fun at gender norms. In “The House of Hidden Meanings,” he describes the look as “mohawk-and-extensions, tribal apocalyptic Thunderdome.”",
            "Drag brought RuPaul his earliest sense of community, uniting him with kindred misfits. But, with his striking height and confidence, and his new look, he also stood apart. “I thought he had, like, fallen out of the sky,” Larry Tee, the d.j. and club promoter, who was one of his close friends and collaborators during that period, later said. “I thought he was an alien.” In those years, RuPaul was in a constant state of creative self-promotion. He started a series of musical groups, first performing as RuPaul and the U-Hauls, then as Wee Wee Pole. (He made some of his earliest costumes on Renetta’s sewing machine—“tasteful ones,” he writes, “like leopard-print catsuits with fringe down the side.”) He began performing as a go-go dancer, then created his own avant-garde drag revues, which he brought to New York clubs like the Pyramid and Illusions. He advertised these appearances with posters bearing catchphrases like “RUPAUL IS EVERYTHING” and “RUPAUL IS RED HOT,” which he taped to telephone poles. “I have never met anyone in my life that is as driven as RuPaul,” the performer known as Flloyd, another friend from that era, later told a documentarian. “The first day I met him, we drank a whole bottle of Jack Daniel’s and I was laying on the couch going, ‘Uhhh,’ and Ru was, like, ‘Let’s go to Kinko’s! Let’s make posters of me!’ ”",
            "The early performances could be political, and often framed drag as liberation from oppressive norms. He opened one show, at the Pyramid Club, as a slave on a plantation. “I hate being a slave,” he said, in a breathy, Marilyn Monroe stage whisper. Then he rose to his feet, swimming in mismatched oversized layers of leopard print, crimped hair wild, intoning in a baritone, “I’m a slave. And you’re a slave. And we’re just gonna break out.”",
            "He put himself in front of cameras whenever he could; once, he wrote to an Atlanta public-access variety program called “The American Music Show” and insisted that, since he would soon be a star, he should be booked as a guest. The hosts of the program had never had anyone write to them before. RuPaul soon became a regular. With friends, including Lady Bunny, he made micro-budget short films on Super 8, among them the sexed-up slasher “Trilogy of Terror,” based on the anthology starring Karen Black. Another series of shorts, “Starbooty,” followed, with RuPaul playing a model turned spy in the mold of blaxploitation divas like Cleopatra Jones, reinterpreted in his “Mad Max” aesthetic. “Really, it was just an excuse to change clothes,” Jon Witherspoon, the director of “Starbooty,” later recalled.",
            "In the mid-eighties, when RuPaul was making frequent trips between Atlanta and New York, he met Barbato and Fenton Bailey, who were in a pop act called the Fabulous Pop Tarts but had aspirations to be filmmakers. They have different memories of the first encounter. Bailey told me that he was in a car in Atlanta, and, turning a corner, was confronted by an indelible image: “in the headlights of the car, there was this extraordinary creature pasting these posters.” Barbato recalled meeting him in the lobby of the Marriott Marquis, in Times Square. “He had football shoulder pads on, thigh-high waders, you know, rubber wading boots, and he was dressed like such a freak,” Barbato said. “And it was like seeing a huge star. I was dazzled.”",
            "RuPaul spent Memorial Day of 1986 with Barbato and Bailey in a studio in Manhattan, recording an album built around the “Starbooty” character. “Ru always, always had specific ideas of ‘I want this to sound like that,’ like, he knew music so well,” Barbato said. (“The House of Hidden Meanings” is, among other things, a love letter to RuPaul’s musical inspirations—the songs referenced throughout make up a playlist of about six hours, with cuts of classic rock, disco, and nineties R. & B.) A few years after “Starbooty,” Barbato directed the music video for “Supermodel,” which featured RuPaul vamping around New York, chanting “Sashay, shanté,” before having a slapstick nervous breakdown, replete with snarling and wig-snatching. The song reached No. 1 on Billboard’s dance singles chart, and the video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for best dance video. (It lost to En Vogue’s “Free Your Mind.”)",
            "RuPaul’s earliest collaborations with Barbato and Bailey are among their most winning. For Channel 4, in the U.K., the trio worked on a gonzo cable-news series titled “Manhattan Cable.” RuPaul served as a field correspondent. In one segment, he walked around downtown Manhattan, like Dan Rather in a faux-cheetah coat and platform heels, collecting the stories of sex workers. “The meat market is filled with transvestite hookers by night,” RuPaul tells the camera. And then, with a figurative wink: “Maybe I’ll make my rent money.” His exchanges with the sex workers are frank and sensitive. He likes them, and they seem to like him. As a punch line, he gets into a client’s car and drives off.",
            "The team has continued to build projects around RuPaul ever since. After experiments in different genres—“The RuPaul Show,” a talk show he hosted in full drag, ran on VH1 for a hundred episodes from 1996 to 1998—in the early aughts they devised, with another producer, Tom Campbell, the idea that would become “Drag Race.” RuPaul was initially reluctant. “There was the meeting where Ru was, like, I’ll do anything but a reality competition show,” Bailey told me. But eventually he was won over. “Drag was perceived as some crazy novelty,” Barbato said. “Ru understood having the familiarity of a competition format would help us give something familiar to the networks.” Every platform they pitched passed on the show, except for the L.G.B.T.Q.+ channel Logo TV, where “Drag Race” ran for eight seasons, becoming the network’s most watched program, before moving to VH1 and then to MTV.",
            "As RuPaul became more popular, he changed his look to a less challenging aesthetic that he refers to as “high-femme Glamazon.” He writes about the first time he performed in a more feminine costume, at a wedding-themed drag show, where he wore a white strapless dress with a Dior-style cinched waist. He felt “some energy shift . . . I was finally getting sexual attention.” The early forays into aggressive femininity represented his “Black-hooker phase,” he told me. “I don’t know if that’s politically correct . . . but that was my look. It was like a ‘Soul Train’ dancer.” By the time of “Supermodel,” however, he was moving away from such overt sexuality. The décolletage was becoming more modest, the gowns more polished. “I desexualized all the way,” he told me. The change was not universally welcomed. It “caused a bit of a tiff from the other drag queens who he’d come up with in New York. They kind of labelled it as ‘RuPaul goes to the mall.’ They were all angry,” Jimmy Harry, who co-wrote “Supermodel,” once said. “But I think that was necessary for him to kind of become a commercial entity.”",
            "RuPaul’s rise has made him a target for criticism within the queer community. In an interview with the Guardian, in 2018, he wondered whether physically transitioned transgender women should compete on the show. “Probably not,” he said. “It takes on a different thing; it changes the whole concept of what we’re doing.” The show has long featured transgender competitors, but early seasons were dominated by those who identified as gay, male, and cisgender. Gia Gunn, a contestant, told New York, “There were trans women who were putting their transitions on hold and purposely not taking hormones leading up to the show.” Another contestant, Monica Beverly Hillz, told the queer Web site Them that, after a struggle to fund her transition through sex work, “Drag Race helped me escape that world, but their world was never really made for me either.” More recent seasons have had transgender winners, including Kylie Sonique Love, Willow Pill, and Sasha Colby. “I didn’t have a single issue,” Jinkx Monsoon, who identified as transfemme during her most recent win on the show, told me. “Every season, it becomes more and more mindful of what’s going on in the actual drag world. . . . People want to call Ru transphobic. And I just think that’s really hard for me to believe, given Ru’s history.” In “The House of Hidden Meanings,” RuPaul describes a life in drag entwined with trans performers, a community he speaks of with apparent affection. But he has built a career on sidestepping gender norms in a way that involves ignoring identity labels, which can be in tension with contemporary discourse. He doesn’t much like to talk about the issue. “Gender is a concept that we come up with, in our minds and our egos,” he told me. “My genitals are male. But I can be whatever I can. I feel I’m everything. You are everything. You are male, female. Sometimes I feel more male than others.”",
            "Criticism also followed an interview with NPR, in 2020, in which he suggested that fracking, an environmentally destructive practice used to extract fossil fuels, was taking place on his husband’s Wyoming ranch. RuPaul remains defiantly annoyed about the matter. “Do you buy gas?” he said to me. “Before you point the finger, smell it first, bitch.” He sounds weary when discussing these controversies. “There’s no combination of words I can put together that would soothe the mob,” he said.",
            "Sam Lansky, a writer who helped RuPaul with “The House of Hidden Meanings,” told me, “He has been, in some ways, sort of misread in terms of his beliefs, or his politics,” contributing to “a world-weariness that he has, and this kind of pessimism that everything is gonna go bad.”",
            "In the memoir, RuPaul treats most celebrities he’s encountered with diplomacy, if not reverence. An exception is Madonna, whom he describes giving him a “snarl of contempt” at a club in the eighties. “In aging, there is a natural flow,” he told me. “And, when you’re against the flow, it doesn’t look right, it doesn’t feel right. The energy around the Madonna thing—it feels weird, right?” He referred to “chasing arena tours and grills in your teeth.” He added, “I’m not interested in appealing to eleven-to-twenty-five-year-olds, I’m just not. I can, on a bigger level, as a mother. As Mama Ru. It’s a different relationship—I’m not trying to be them.”",
            "At Pinewood, RuPaul emerged from a bathroom, decked out for a non-drag segment of the show in a Trina Turk suit with a swirling, psychedelic maroon print. Thairin Smothers, one of his producers, handed him a paper cup of hot water with lemon, then followed him into a TV studio. Under fuchsia lights, a set for “Snatch Game,” a sendup of “Match Game,” awaited. In the segment, a staple of “Drag Race,” a panel of contestants, each impersonating a celebrity, attempts to complete a phrase, trying to match answers provided by celebrity guests. The episode’s guests were Rachel Stevens and John Lee, of the pop group S Club. Opposite them sat drag renditions of Elvis Presley, Liza Minnelli, Marie Antoinette, a dragon, and other characters. RuPaul, cue cards in hand, set them up for witty comebacks to questions.",
            "This was a light makeup day: for non-drag segments, RuPaul applies his own eyebrows, using four different products. Raven, the makeup artist, was nevertheless watching the monitors in case touch-ups were needed. She told me that she had worked with RuPaul on seven seasons of television in 2023 alone. “I literally fill a suitcase, go home, fill another suitcase, go again,” she said. Smothers corrected her. “Lingo,” a game show on CBS that RuPaul began hosting last year, had made a season, too. “It all kind of blends together after seventeen years,” Smothers said, watching the monitors. Many of the “Drag Race” staff have worked on the show for a decade or more. For all RuPaul’s boundary-setting, the atmosphere can be unusually familial for TV. Under the lights at Pinewood, the queen playing Liza Minnelli tried out an old standard, snapping, “I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” and RuPaul howled with laughter.",
            "A few days later, RuPaul woke up and performed his morning ritual. First, he stretched. “I’m older,” he said. “I have to make sure everything is doing the thing.” Then he prayed, saying aloud the words “Dear God, thank you,” followed by things for which he is grateful. That week, the list included the roof over his head, his access to running water, and Georges, his husband, whom he met while dancing at Limelight, in New York, in the nineties. After that, he meditated, a practice that can last anywhere from forty-five seconds to fifteen minutes. He lets the ideas drift through: “Oh, there’s my father. Oh, there’s Judy Garland.” His demons are there, too, but he claims to have befriended them. He put on another black hoodie and another pair of black workout pants and walked ten minutes to the nearest Marks & Spencer to pick up an apple turnover.",
            "Soon afterward, we sat in the living room of his rental cottage, a modest, two-story structure with neutral walls and a tiny kitchenette to which he had added, as far as I could tell, nothing but a row of identical boxes of berry-flavored Special K. “I brought this in,” he said, pointing to an LCD monitor that sat, with his laptop, on an otherwise empty white desk. “And I moved this chair. That’s about it.” Yet he was crazy about the place—he liked the flow of the floor plan, and took pictures of it, to try to replicate it in Wyoming.",
            "RuPaul is, in profound ways, a loner. For much of his adult life, he had felt alienated from the easy intimacy of casual gay sex. “In my twenties and stuff, when I was meeting someone at a bar or something, I always would want to find some type of connection, but it was not there,” he said. “And I did not enjoy being with somebody I don’t have a connection to.”",
            "His Black identity didn’t furnish much sense of community, either. “I come from a Black family,” he said. “But I always felt different. Not better or anything. I just felt like Ru.” In the memoir, he recounts a moment, two years after his move to Atlanta, when his father grilled him about rumors that he was having gay sex. “In the Black church, ‘gay’ represents something against the family, and the family is an extension of how Black people survived from slavery,” he told me. “So my existence becomes a threat to the family, because I’m other than.” I expected that he would suggest that he now relishes his role as a trailblazing celebrity in the Black community. “I’ve won fourteen Emmys. And you would think I’d have been on the cover of Ebony, if that still exists,” he said. “I don’t represent what the Black community wants to lift up. I never have.” His computer’s desktop showed a black-and-white closeup of Diana Ross. From an early age, he admired her ability to craft an image that was unthreatening to white audiences. “I went, That’s what I want to do. I want to be on a world stage and not be questioned, or make people feel threatened,” he said. “Most Black people in our culture have to not scare white folks.”",
            "RuPaul told me that his social life is circumscribed, in some ways, by design. “I meet new people, but like, socially, do I go out to dinner with people, or meet someone and say, ‘Hey, let’s go on a hike’? Very rarely.” He and his husband have an open relationship. “It’s just realistic,” he said. “There’s no such thing as monogamy with men.” But, he said, because of his fame, there’s no longer “a circle of people that I can sort of rely on” for intimacy.",
            "When Georges and he first met, Georges asked if he could floss RuPaul’s teeth. RuPaul, horrified, said no. But Georges eventually got past his guardedness. While I was with RuPaul, Georges FaceTimed him from a hospital room, where he was recovering from a minor medical procedure. “Oh, my God, look at you,” RuPaul said. “Did you get the morphine I told you to get?” And then: “I love you.” At one point, while we were talking, RuPaul mentioned his name, smiled, and then started to cry.",
            "“I would love to have more fun,” he told me. “I would love to go to a fucking roller disco. Why aren’t there fucking roller discos? What’s the deal? People have lost track of what’s really fun.” RuPaul has his own skates, and he’s nimble. Occasionally, he will drive to a remote parking lot and skate by himself. But he finds the kind of night life he once loved to be inaccessible. “You know, at a night club or at a disco dance place, people are on their phones,” he said. “How am I going to be spiritual and in the moment, sweating, and take my shirt off, where there are people filming?”",
            "Lansky, the writer, described to me what he thought of as RuPaul’s foundational beliefs: “Don’t take anything too seriously. Don’t treat anything as sacred. Stay in play, nurture your inner child.” For all its profitability, “Drag Race” still ropes contestants into campy, small-budget music-video shoots that mirror his own experiments on “The American Music Show,” in Atlanta: creations with little artistry and lots of cheap wigs and improv. Before he dropped out of high school, a drama teacher scolded him for caring about his precarious academic career, telling him, “RuPaul, don’t take life too fucking seriously.” The admonition has since become a mantra. “I’m always looking to play,” he said. “I want to be in that state all the time.”",
            "RuPaul has been sober since the late nineties. In “The House of Hidden Meanings,” he describes years of alcohol abuse that he now views as an effort to “anesthetize” himself, and also his eventual decision to seek treatment, spurred by his effort to help Georges, who was addicted to crystal meth. But he remains a proponent of psychedelics, and told me that early acid trips provided essential perspective on the importance of being in a state of play. “That’s why hallucinogens are so wonderful. Because your self-consciousness is stripped away when you’re tripping your balls,” he said. The spiritual guru he finds most influential, he said, is “my fucking idol, Bugs Bunny. Who is a fucking Zen master.” His teachings: “Don’t take other people too serious. And stay ahead of their stupidity. If you have to, build a fucking compound somewhere, but stay ahead of their own self-destructive, ridiculous mentality.”",
            "RuPaul has been trying to outrun that kind of thinking for a long time. He recalled an appearance he made, in full drag, on “The Arsenio Hall Show,” in 1993—a radical act, at the time. “In the moment, on ‘Arsenio Hall,’ I’m up against the status quo and the machine,” he recalled. “There is pain in that.”",
            "He got up and served me the apple turnover. With his face shadowed by the hoodie and bare of makeup, he looked ascetic and almost otherworldly. He told me he’d been reflecting on his comment about not liking kids. “I would be a great parent,” he said. Though he would fear sending a child into a world he finds inhospitable and dangerous, he added, “I would love that kid so much.” The cottage is near a school. “The bell just rang,” he said. “You know, last year, when I took this place, I thought, Oh, God, the kids, they’re gonna drive me crazy.” Now, he told me, “I fucking love hearing their voices out there. It’s kind of this white noise of joy.” ♦",

            "[The husband-and-wife filmmakers discuss “Drive-Away Dolls,” untraditional marriage, and their planned lesbian trilogy.]",
            "Few things are more comedically satisfying than an odd-couple pairing. Oscar and Felix, Lucy and Ethel, Tom Wambsgans and Cousin Greg: if the tensions are plentiful, so are the laffs. In “Drive-Away Dolls,” the new caper from the married couple Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, we have Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan), two lesbian friends, in 1999, who can’t avoid rubbing each other the wrong way. Jamie is a Texan live wire, all twang and sexual bravado, and Marian is a guarded Henry James reader in a pussy-bow blouse. When Jamie’s girlfriend, Sukie (Beanie Feldstein), tosses her out of the house for cheating, Jamie joins Marian on a trip from Philadelphia to Tallahassee, and the two find themselves in the midst of a complicated scheme involving a severed head, assorted dildos, a crooked conservative senator, and a mysterious briefcase.",
            "“Ethan thinks I’m like Jamie,” Cooke said on a Zoom call the other day, from a wooden-raftered Airbnb in Albuquerque, where the couple are shooting another movie. “I’m a glass-half-full person. Ethan can kind of spiral into—”",
            "“I’m like Marian,” Coen interjected. He had a close-cropped salt-and-pepper beard and wore black-rimmed glasses. “I’m the worrier.” He sighed. “Sometimes I get infuriated with Trish for not worrying!”",
            "“I admit I can be a little cavalier,” Cooke conceded. She had on black-rimmed glasses like her husband’s, and her brown hair fell straight down her back.",
            "“Me, on the other hand, all I’ve got are my fears!” Coen said.",
            "When casting “Drive-Away Dolls,” the couple quickly found their Marian in Viswanathan. It was harder to find a Jamie—“someone who is charismatic and reckless but then can turn sweet very easily,” Cooke said. Qualley was a last-minute addition. “Before you find the person, it’s an enormous locus of anxiety for me,” Coen said. He considered “No Country for Old Men,” the Oscar-winning movie, from 2007, that he made with his brother, Joel, and said, “The most anxious part of my life was until we cast Josh Brolin, and that was just three weeks before we had to start shooting. I was, like, ‘We’re fucked.’ ”",
            "For the past four decades, Ethan has worked with Joel on a slew of movies that examine man’s darkly violent impulses through an absurdist lens. After “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” was released, in 2018, Ethan decided to take a break. “He kind of semi-retired,” Cooke said.",
            "A couple of years later, however, during the pandemic, he dipped his toe in again, by co-directing, with Cooke, a documentary, “Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind,” which came out in 2022. “We had a lot of fun working on it together,” Cooke said. As an editor, she has cut many of the Coens’ movies, including “The Big Lebowski” and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” The enforced hiatus of covid also prodded them to dig up a script they’d written in the early two-thousands. They decided to rewrite it. It was originally titled “Drive-Away Dykes.”",
            "“Me and Ethan met on a movie in 1989, in New Orleans, and we were very close friends, best friends, for years,” Cooke said. “I’d come out in college, and I identified as a lesbian.”",
            "“I come from Minneapolis, where there are no lesbians!” Coen said. “So, this was all new and exciting to me.”",
            "Cooke laughed. “At some point, I was, like, This is silly. He’s the person I want to spend all my time with. So, we made that work. And still do.”",
            "They’ve been married since 1993, have two grown children, and live together, but their relationship is open. “I felt like I was losing my lesbian identity, and we were, like, O.K., let’s change our marriage to make it work,” Cooke said.",
            "“It wasn’t vexed or problematic,” Coen said. “We kind of fell into it, and it seemed natural.”",
            "“Drive-Away Dolls” is the first of a projected lesbian trilogy. The second installment, a detective genre piece titled “Honey Don’t!,” is the project that brought them to New Mexico. Although it’s more noir than comedy, they want it to retain the feel of a B movie. “The world is a rough place,” Cooke said. “And I do a lot of political-activism work, so, for me, to tell stories that are a little bit silly or trashy or stupid, it’s just a sigh of relief.”",
            "The silliness is still a lot of work. “Ethan is always working,” Cooke went on. She turned to her husband. “There’s never a spare minute in your day.”",
            "“That’s actually not true,” he protested, not too convincingly. (This past summer, he wrote a new screenplay with his brother.) “I sit around looking into space most of the time.”",
            "“It’s the life of the mind!” Cooke said.",
            "“O.K., we’ll call it that!” Coen said. ♦",

            "[The paper championed a new style of journalism at a time when the persistence of silence and constraint was more plausibly imagined than a world awash in personal truths.]",
            "Naturally, a moment matters. In this case, a moment that was also, and might be considered still, a place: fixed, discernable, real. A community already dreaming of itself as a site of ferment and change, already wishing to stay the same. The idea was to capture and reflect something of this moment, this place, but also to capitalize, to fill a perceived void with what was presumed to be lacking. It being 1955, in New York City, a newspaper was the thing—one fashioned by and for the self-styled bohemians of Greenwich Village, a neighborhood of nearly two hundred square, trapezoidal, and triangle-shaped blocks in the city’s downtown.",
            "Founded by three veterans of the Second World War with zero journalistic or publishing experience, this paper would conjure its authority by other than the usual means. A sort of conjured authority, the men suspected—they were all men, and all white—might suit their market well. Tabloid in form, the paper would be printed weekly, chronicling, but also manifesting, with each issue the context from which it sprang. A context of questioning, confluence, independent thought, advocacy, a personal eye (and “I”) turned on matters of every kind, but mostly those too local or unusual to bear mention in the newspaper of record, headquartered uptown. They decided to call their publication the Village Voice, despite its rejection of that uptown paper’s univocality, and its mandate, in fact, of the opposite: of voices, voices everywhere.",
            "The founders—a fledgling psychologist named Ed Fancher, the pseudoliterary Rotarian Dan Wolf, and Norman Mailer, who provided fifteen thousand dollars, a short-lived column, and not much more—believed that time would clarify the nature and viability of their experiment, and time did, across a moment that comprised more than six decades, at least eight owners, and at least one mass-extinction event. When the latest of its publishers, the multibillionaire retail heir Peter Barbey, shuttered the Voice, in 2018, a Times article quoted a lament from the journalist Tom Robbins, one of the many marquee personalities who, through their decades-long association with the paper, became synonymous with its brand. “It’s astonishing that this is happening in New York,” Robbins said, “the biggest media town in America.” That second part struck a wistful tone even then, a year when social media added nearly a million new users every day and the global population was projected to spend a combined billion years online. By the time the Voice had assumed its current semi-undead form, following a 2020 resurrection, the creeping irrelevance of any bounded and singular context—including that of a town, much less “the biggest media town in America”—had become the kind of thing a person might fail to notice while engaged in the ruthless business of noticing everything else.",
            "Those outlets now referred to as “legacy media” have survived in part by adopting elements first innovated by the Voice, which, in its coverage of beats ranging from City Hall and CBGB to the odd foreign revolution, demonstrated a radical embrace of the subjective, a prizing of argument and opinion, of lived experience over expertise. Determined to both maintain and eat away at its own boundaries, it became a critical, journalistic, and publishing titan, a context unto itself. In the opening pages of “The Freaks Came Out to Write,” Tricia Romano’s new and raucous oral history of the paper, Howard Blum, a former staff writer, is the first to declare the Voice “a precursor to the internet,” an idea that recurs, with diminishing shine, throughout the book’s five hundred and thirty pages. Notes of elegy sound throughout, laments for something too good to last, but also for a moment of honest and urgent revolt. When there seemed no such thing as too many voices, or an excess of subjectivity—when, on and off the page, the persistence of silence and constraint were far more plausibly imagined than a world awash in personal truths.",
            "Structured in short, chronologically ordered chapters, “The Freaks Came Out to Write” unfolds like the kind of epic, many-roomed party that invokes the spirit of other parties and their immortal ghosts. Romano escorts the reader from room to room, where a set of relevant players hold forth on the subject at hand. Here are Michael Smith and Lucian K. Truscott IV, hashing out how a line about the “forces of faggotry” made it into the latter’s firsthand account of the 1969 Stonewall protests. Over there, Vivian Gornick, Ellen Willis, and Susan Brownmiller discuss the double bind of writing about women’s issues for a paper that afforded them, in Gornick’s words, “the most astonishing amount of space and time,” despite a workplace blighted by what the critic Laurie Stone elsewhere calls “ordinary, old-school, male fuckheads.” The sort of men who would publish a letter like the one written by James Wolcott, who would later become a staff writer, belittling her 1971 piece “On Goosing,” about being sexually accosted in public. “God help us if she ever gets raped,” Wolcott wrote. “We will be buried under an avalanche of rhetoric.”",
            "Romano’s book is designed to abet a case for the Voice as a kind of nexus of twentieth-century incident, and most chapters offer an inside history of familiar events. We learn how the reporting of a local activist named Mary Perot Nichols helped defeat Robert Moses’s plan to build various highways across lower Manhattan; how an early profile of Spike Lee (instigated by Lee himself) led to funding for “She’s Gotta Have It,” his breakout film; how Wayne Barrett’s 1979 exposé of Donald Trump’s business dealings raised an alarm that would clatter for decades to come. Occasionally, this fervent dot-connecting grows strained, as in a chapter that intersects the Voice with graffiti culture, breakdancing, and the emergence of Jean-Michel Basquiat. But the over-all effect echoes the former editor-in-chief Karen Durbin’s conception of the Voice as “a great bar in the Village, a funky bar,” full of gossip, squabbling, and well-earned nostalgia. The longing is for a lost paradise of synergy and shared purpose, a season of what Guy Trebay describes as a “porosity” between worlds, when an eclectic staff, their subjects, and a growing legion of readers agreed on a core set of interests and values. “We all said some stupid things,” the longtime Voice movie critic Andrew Sarris says, of the savage feuding among his colleagues. “But film seemed to matter so much.”",
            "Romano, who covered the New York club scene during her eight years at the Voice, amassed her cast of characters from a combination of archival research and more than two hundred original interviews. Effectively a work of collage, the oral history must find unity through arrangement and juxtaposition, the recontextualizing of untethered quotes. Billed in its subtitle as “the definitive history” of “the radical paper that changed American culture,” “The Freaks Came Out to Write,” in foregrounding the disparate perspectives of its writers and editors, proposes paradox and contradiction as two of the Voice’s operating principles. Certainly an entrenched antagonism between the so-called whiteboys—gumshoe journalists who occupied the front of the book, including Barrett, Jack Newfield, and Nat Hentoff—and the nonwhite, queer, and women writers who dominated the culture and review sections seems to have powered the paper’s function and dysfunction alike. Residue of that bitterness clings to this history, outlasting many of the players in question.",
            "Writers also dish on their favorite editors (Marianne Partridge, the paper’s first female editor-in-chief, was beloved by reporters; David Schneiderman slowly won the hearts of those who held his Times pedigree in contempt), the peak era (the sixties; no, the nineties; perhaps the decades in between), when and why it all seemed to go wrong (usually when someone sold the paper for a whopping sum, beginning with the multimillion-dollar payout to Wolf and Fancher, in 1970). True to form, mostly the writers talk about themselves, and one another: Harry Allen riffs on Greg Tate’s “rabidly combinatorial” critical voice; Paul Berman describes the British media critic Alexander Cockburn as “a brilliant stylist in a certain limited way,” producer of a “marvelous column if you ignore what he actually said in it.” Consensus forms around a culture of indulgence: “There was nothing that the Voice wouldn’t let you do”; “We never used one word when seventeen would do.” Brownmiller once counted the number of times “I” appeared in someone’s story. “You would think that they were the internet,” Gornick says. “They let us go on and on and on.”",
            "The reader is left to wonder at the idea of Rupert Murdoch, who owned the Voice from 1977 to 1985, overseeing an era of prosperity and relative calm at a paper that by then had found a sweet spot between staying true to its outsider image and the successful retail of same. As long as the paper made money, it seems, Murdoch would tolerate even the constant attacks on him within its folds. The business side gets scant treatment in these pages; we learn of readership surges during the 1962-63 New York City newspaper strike and another across the latter half of that decade (when circulation grew to exceed that of of ninety-five per cent of American big-city dailies), but the paper’s economic systems remain largely obscure.",
            "Until, that is, those systems come to dominate the story, beginning with the decision, in 1996, to make the Voice free, available around town in “urine-soaked boxes,” what the former editor-in-chief David Blum calls “the most disgusting distribution model I’ve ever seen in my entire life.” Then comes Craigslist, a series of sales to investor groups and media conglomerates, a scandal involving “adult services” ads and allegations of sex trafficking, and a lingering question about whether it all could have gone otherwise—if the Voice could have survived the erasure of the moment that defined it as an alternative, a thing apart from other things. Though aspects of its style and attitude have scaled uncommonly well, the paper’s success depended at least as much on its relationship to a fruitful context, a thing of scant value in a culture that mostly refers to itself.",
            "Often, these days, I find myself in conversation with students seeking advice not about how or what to write but where to try and publish the thing they haven’t yet written. These students tend to be in transition, mid-pivot, escaping or avoiding work in one of the industries now described as a “space,” despite lacking much that qualifies as fixed, discernable, real. Confronted with this question, I always counter with one of my own—“What are you reading?”—in part because it was how I and every writer I know first set about attaching our blobby ambitions to an actual goal. It’s true that they can’t, or at least don’t, mention the Village Voice, in which I published almost two hundred and fifty reviews and stories over nine years, and which helped pay my rent as a writer new to the city. (In its current online incarnation, the Voice can feel like it exists mostly as a host to its vast archives; newly published stories appear on the home page, but the rest of the site’s various sections favor a selection of older pieces.) But you would not know, from the mild affront and confusion with which students greet my question—as though I had inquired after some unknowable data set, like the exact date and time of their deaths—that other publications do indeed still exist.",
            "A familiar gulf opens between student and professor, then, one I have come to regard with more tenderness than annoyance. What my students seek is what I sought: not just a place to publish, of which there remain plenty, but a place to aspire to, the kind of established, vital ecosystem within which a writer can learn, play, feud, create meaning, spark conversation, make sense of herself and her world. Rare by definition, such things grow more elusive by the day. The legacy of the Voice resides in its embodiment of a time when publishing a neighborhood paper that would reflect for its readers, as Ed Fancher put it, “the intellectual and artistic firmament” of their community could matter as much as it turned out to do. ♦"

Shaina Taub’s women’s-suffrage musical, “Suffs” (Music Box; March 26), transfers from the Public with Hillary Clinton among the producers—a rallying cry in an election year.

At the Joyce (March 26-31), Soulier’s piece is performed alongside “Glacial Decoy” (1979), a beautiful, spare work by Brown in which luminous dancers clad in white pleated dresses move, with loose-limbed elegance, in front of black-and-white images of everyday places.

            "The following month, the Joyce shines a light on the work of the jazz innovator Max Roach, born a hundred years ago, with a program of dances, in “Max Roach 100” (April 2-7). Inspired by the drummer’s flexible, almost pointillist use of rhythm, three choreographers, working in different modes, take on Roach’s catalogue. Ronald K. Brown has made a fluid West African-influenced piece for an ensemble of Cuban and American dancers, set to Roach’s 1961 Afro-Cuban album, “Percussion Bitter Sweet.” Rennie Harris applies his sophisticated brand of hip-hop to Roach’s “The Dream/It’s Time,” which contains a dialogue between percussion and Martin Luther King’s voice. And, in a twenty-minute solo, Ayodele Casel, a tap choreographer with a rhythmic and sonic range to rival Roach’s, riffs on a series of duets that Roach recorded with the pianist Cecil Taylor, in 1979.",
            "The Martha Graham Dance Company celebrates its centenary a little early—Graham’s first choreographic evening wasn’t until 1926—with revivals of classic dances by Graham and Agnes de Mille, plus a new commission (City Center; April 17-20). The most classic of all is Graham’s “Appalachian Spring,” from 1944, whose choreography, music (by Aaron Copland), and set (by Isamu Noguchi) have come to represent a certain idea of the spaciousness of the West. Another of Copland’s evocations of America, “Rodeo,” has been adapted for bluegrass ensemble, to accompany a restaging of de Mille’s ballet of the same name. (Graham and de Mille were not only contemporaries but close friends.) The young choreographer Jamar Roberts, lately of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, creates his first dance for the company, set to a folk-and-gospel score by Rhiannon Giddens, a vocal artist with a knack for reinvention.—Marina Harss",

            "Hiroshige’s Edo, Jenny Holzer’s Scrolls",
            "The theme of this year’s Whitney Biennial (opening March 20), entitled “Even Better Than the Real Thing,” splits the difference between the topical and the timeless. The co-curators Chrissie Iles and Meg Onli say they have emphasized art that explores shifting definitions of reality—also known as all art, you might argue, though the reality of the twenty-twenties has fluctuated like the price of cryptocurrency and seems particularly in need of artists who can make sense of it. There are sixty-nine of them (plus two collectives) in the new installment.",
            "The early-twentieth-century German artist Käthe Kollwitz devoted her life to expressing “the sufferings of men,” and her Expressionist prints and drawings are as sombre as that pledge makes them sound. But they’re also joyfully inventive in their depictions of weavers, soldiers, and struggling mothers, and together they constitute something close to a history of their maker’s country in its darkest decades. For Kollwitz’s first major exhibition at a New York museum (March 31), MOMA has assembled roughly a hundred and twenty works, the better to make a full-throated case for her importance to art, politics, and political art.",
            "With “Hiroshige’s 100 Famous Views of Edo (feat. Takashi Murakami)” (April 5), the Brooklyn Museum is showing one of the most glittery treasures in its permanent collection for the first time in nearly a quarter century. Hiroshige’s series of woodblock prints—produced in the years leading up to his death, in 1858, and thereafter completed by his apprentice, Hiroshige II—is inaccurately named: there are a hundred and eighteen views in all. Considering that “Views” has a claim to being the single greatest creation of the single greatest Japanese artist, however, showing more than advertised doesn’t seem like a bad thing. An accompanying set of Takashi Murakami paintings riffs on the prints’ calm with madcap Surrealism.",
            "The Native American artist Rose B. Simpson is having a good year. Her work appears in the Whitney Biennial, and for the twentieth anniversary of the Madison Square Park Conservancy’s public-art program she has contributed a set of figurative sculptures in steel and bronze; while these occupy Madison Square Park, two others will be on view in Inwood Hill Park. The second location wasn’t lightly chosen. It’s believed to be the site where Dutch settlers “bought” the island of Manhattan from the Lenape tribe, for next to nothing—a sour truth that gives this two-part outdoor exhibition, “Seed” (April 11), a tone that is both outraged and triumphant.",
            "Frederick Kiesler was a mutant creature of the early twentieth century: an experimental designer who was also an artist who was also an inventor, writer, architect, professor, and all-round charismatically wacky visionary. The Jewish Museum’s exhibition “Frederick Kiesler: Vision Machines” (April 25) examines his tenure as the director of the Laboratory for Design Correlation, at Columbia University, during which he pursued projects such as the Mobile Home Library, a rotating-shelf device that has been constructed specially for this occasion, close to a century after he dreamed it up.",

            "American Identity, Climate Change, Bach in Modern Times",
            "Thirty-five years ago, the inner wall of the Guggenheim Museum was dressed in curling ribbons of L.E.D. lights. The dresser, Jenny Holzer, has spent her career composing koan-like phrases and turning them into signs that lurk in museums and public places, waiting to pounce. In “Jenny Holzer: Light Line” (Guggenheim; May 17), a reimagining of the earlier show, she brings back her old words and adds new ones, some generated by artificial intelligence. A natural response to all this may well be confusion, but, as the artist herself tells us, “CONFUSING YOURSELF IS A WAY TO STAY HONEST.”—Jackson Arn",
            "This spring, artists are engaging in seemingly spontaneous conversations with one another across performances—about identity, climate, and how to contextualize canonical composers for contemporary audiences.",
            "American works about cruelly thwarted dreams hit the stage. The choir MasterVoices gives a concert of Ricky Ian Gordon’s “The Grapes of Wrath,” an opera that shines with goodness, at Carnegie Hall (April 17). Huang Ruo and David Henry Hwang’s opera “An American Soldier,” about the tragic death of the Chinese American private Danny Chen, shortly after he joined the Army, in 2011, has its New York première, at PAC NYC (select dates May 12-19).",
            "The Miró Quartet’s brief survey of twentieth- and twenty-first-century American art music, at the Church of the Intercession, in Harlem (May 4), adopts a tenderly elegiac tone, with famed string pieces by George Walker and Samuel Barber. Other ensembles fill in that history with missing voices. At Town Hall, Kronos Quartet and Ghost Train Orchestra delve into the extensive catalogue of Moondog (April 16), a blind composer of simple, catchy songs, who was known as the “viking of Sixth Avenue” for the horned helmet and cloak that he wore on the streets of New York in the fifties and sixties. For the centenary of the Black composer Julia Perry’s birth, the Experiential Orchestra mounts a four-day festival, which closes at Alice Tully Hall with Perry’s aching Prelude for Strings and her piquant Violin Concerto (March 16).",
            "John Adams’s “El Niño,” a Nativity oratorio that humanizes Mary’s experience of motherhood, has its Metropolitan Opera première (select dates April 23-May 17). Dan Schlosberg and Amanda Quaid’s “The Extinctionist,” in Heartbeat Opera’s first world première, also contends with a birth: a woman wrestles with the moral dilemma of bringing a child into a world that appears to be falling apart as a result of global warming (Baruch Performing Arts Center; select dates April 2-14).",
            "The director Peter Sellars, whose work is both visionary and humane, likewise concerns himself with climate collapse in “Shall We Gather at the River,” an original show that weaves together spirituals and Bach cantatas, at the Park Avenue Armory (May 21); the cast includes the smooth-voiced countertenor Reginald Mobley. Bach crisscrosses with the modern era in two programs: one by the pianist Simone Dinnerstein, who pairs his lilting sinfonias with music by Keith Jarrett and Philip Lasser, at Miller Theatre (April 25), and the other by the cellist Alisa Weilerstein, who couches Zoltán Kodály’s twisting Sonata for Solo Cello among Bach cello suites, at the 92nd Street Y, New York (April 3).",
            "The Danish String Quartet presents the fourth installment of its “Doppelgänger” series, which pairs a Schubert work with a new commission, this time by the ever-interesting Thomas Adès (April 18), at Carnegie Hall. Paul Lewis, a Schubert interpreter of verve and fluidity, offers his own four-part cycle of the composer’s work—specifically, the piano sonatas—for Peoples’ Symphony Concerts, where tickets cost less than ten dollars with a subscription (various venues; April 27 and May 19).",
            "Also at Carnegie, the American Symphony Orchestra tackles Schoenberg’s “Gurre-Lieder,” a last, magnificent gasp of post-Romanticism in the composer’s œuvre, for the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of his birth (March 22). Mitsuko Uchida, a pianist of engrossingly precise insight, centers her “Perspectives” series on her lodestars Mozart (March 28) and Schubert (April 9). The baritone Matthias Goerne wraps a voice of dark velvet around Schumann’s “Dichterliebe” (April 25), and the sensitive pianist Jan Lisiecki plays Chopin’s Twenty-Four Preludes for his recital début on Carnegie’s main stage (March 13).",

The movie is written and directed by John Ridley; Lance Reddick and Terrence Howard co-star. Marisa Abela plays Amy Winehouse in “Back to Black” (May 17), the story of the singer’s adolescence and too-brief adulthood, written by Matt Greenhalgh and directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson.",
            "Much of life’s most important action takes the form of talk, but Hollywood sees things differently and, as usual, will be filling the screen with rough-and-tumble adventure in a range of genres. “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” (March 22), the franchise’s latest sequel, directed by Gil Kenan, combines members of the first-generation poltergeist patrol (including Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, and Bill Murray) with newcomers (Carrie Coon, Celeste O’Connor, Paul Rudd) who attempt to prevent a new ice age. Alex Garland’s dystopian fantasy “Civil War” (April 12) stars Kirsten Dunst as a journalist covering the violence of a second American civil war involving the secession of Texas and California; Nick Offerman plays the President. “The Fall Guy” (May 3), directed by David Leitch, a former stunt coördinator and a co-director of the first “John Wick” movie, is a comic thriller about a stuntman (Ryan Gosling) who hunts for an actor (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) gone missing from a film that his friend (Emily Blunt) is directing. In the sports romance “Challengers” (April 26), Zendaya plays a tennis coach who is training her husband (Mike Faist) prior to his big match against her ex (Josh O’Connor).",
            "American independent filmmaking returns to prominence with a varied slate of movies. One of the hits of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, “Sasquatch Sunset” (April 12), directed by the brothers David and Nathan Zellner, stars Riley Keough and Jesse Eisenberg as the titular creatures, who make their way across American landscapes. In Bob Byington’s “Lousy Carter” (March 29), David Krumholtz plays a terminally ill literature professor whose professional activities and love life are in chaos. Joanna Arnow wrote and directed “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed” (April 26), a dramedy about a thirtysomething New Yorker (Arnow) who searches for romantic connection and a sexually submissive relationship; it was one of the outstanding entries in last year’s New York Film Festival. Pamela Adlon makes her feature-film directorial début with “Babes” (May 17), starring Ilana Glazer (who co-wrote the script) as a single woman who becomes pregnant and decides to raise the child on her own.",
            "Idiosyncratic offerings are en route from the international cinema, such as “The Beast” (April 5), the French director Bertrand Bonello’s science-fiction spin on a Henry James story of failed romance, “The Beast in the Jungle”; the movie is set in three eras, ranging from the early twentieth century to 2044. The contemporary dystopian tale “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” (March 22), from the Romanian filmmaker Radu Jude, centers on two women named Angela: a production assistant on an industrial-safety video, who is also a social-media provocateur, and a taxi driver who is also the protagonist of a real Romanian movie from 1981. In “La Chimera” (March 29), directed by the Italian filmmaker Alice Rohrwacher, an archeologist haunted by memories of a woman he loved becomes involved with smugglers, whose excavations may open a door to his past.

            "Raye wins RnB Act",
            "“I was told a lie: that RnB doesn’t sell in the UK,” recalls Raye. She shouts out Mahalia, who campaigns to have this award added to the Brits roster.",
            "Neil thinks this win is “a bit reductive if you ask me. She seems a bit surprised by it herself. Her music is bigger and wider than a single genre. It is her second Brit of a possible seven. Still excited, but if she keeps picking up awards all night, she’s gonna be so blasé by the time it comes to the big ones.”",
            "Ellie Goulding believes in a miracle",
            "She’s performing her hit dance track, while wearing a leotard/wedding cake.",
            "Neil says: “Ellie Goulding and Calvin Harris get the dry ice and lasers out. But their best special effect is Ellie’s voice. Who needs autotune when you’ve got built-in vibrato?”",
            "Jungle win Group of the Year",
            "Neil is unimpressed by our next presenter. “‘We are thrilled to be back in the UK with so many amazing artist,’ says Billy Joe Armstrong with all the enthusiasm of a newsreader on Mogadon.",
            "“Group of the year goes to Jungle. They are a really fine bunch of groove masters who have been doing fantastic live work for years, with little acknowledgment. It feels more like a lifetime achievement than recognition for anything from the past year. Blur might feel a little aggrieved but I think Damon Albarn is probably a Jungle fan.”",
            "Raye wins Song of the Year",
            "Post office scandal victim Jo Hamilton and actress Monica Dolan, of that incredible drama, are up to present. “Please keep supporting us, because despite what the Government say, they’re not paying the postmasters,” says Hamilton. Neil notes: “We’re already discussing the postmaster scandal. What a British show the Brits is.”",
            "Neil says: “Raye wins Song of the Year, the first award of the night. Is she going to use this as a platform to vent about the music business, or save her fire for later? It could be a big night, so I hope she’s got enough speeches up her sleeves. Well, she hasn’t got any sleeves, but you know what I mean.”",
            "A sweetly nervous Raye says “I’m shaking” as she looks at her gong. She thanks her small distribution company Human Resources – “no one else would take my songs.” They all look like idiots now.",
            "Neil adds: “Raye already seems a bit overexcited, given that she could be picking up seven of these. ‘Thank you to my team, I’ve always dreamed of saying that…’”",
            "Here come our hosts",
            "That’s Clara Amfo, Maya Jama and nepo baby Roman Kemp. Like everyone, they’re mostly psyched to see Kylie (quite right).",
            "Oh no, they’ve introduced a kiss cam. Peter Crouch refuses to smooch wife Abbey Clancy. Ah, this is all a set-up for Kylie to pretend to kiss Roman Kemp. Awkward.",
            "Dua Lipa opens the show",
            "We’re off! The first performance comes from Dua Lipa, once again rocking the leather – now a jacket, hotpants and boots. Her dancers are all leather-clad too, and are occasionally yanked into the air by wires. It looks like a lost scene from Blade, crossed with a particularly moody Cirque du Soleil show.",
            "Says Neil: “Dua Lipa not wasting any primetime television, kicking things off with a promo for her new single, Training Season, in a pair of shorts skimpy and tight enough to arguably be a tribute to Kylie.”",
            "Who’s taking the big trophies?",
            "Neil says: “Song of the Year. There’s too many contenders to discuss their various merits. But Raye’s fantastic Escapism is in there, so I’m going to give it to her. Should win: Raye. Will win: Raye.",
            "“Best New Artist. Raye is in this category too. But surely you can’t win Best New Artist and Artist of the Year? I’m holding out for the big one for Raye. So out of Mahalia, Olivia Dean, PinkPantheress and Yussef Dayes, I’m going to go eenie-meenie-miney-mo … Should Win: Yussef Dayes. Will win: PinkPantheress.",
            "“Group of the Year. Why are the Rolling Stones not in this category? How does a one-off collaboration between rappers Headie One and K-trap qualify as a group? Are electro-dance duo Chase and Status really a group? Young Fathers are a fierce trio, but still more beloved of critics than the public. So I’ll give this to revived Britpop champions Blur. Should Win: Blur. Will win: Blur.",
            "“There are 10 names in the Artist of the Year category, which is probably to make up for dropping gender-specific categories. I’m not convinced nine of these artists even deserve to be here. Should win: Raye. Will win: Raye.",
            "“Album of the Year. The big one. Were there five British albums last year that really impacted on popular culture? Blur made a stir with their art-rock comeback, and played two shows at Wembley Stadium. J Hus brings a smooth blend of world sounds into his UK hip hop but did he really cut through to the mainstream?",
            "“Little Simz is the most intense and intelligent rapper in the UK, but her album No Thank You was a very dark and personal project that was given a very lowkey release, made no impact on the charts, and doesn’t even aspire to hitting the grand hits of her previous outstanding album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. I’m surprised that she is on this list. Young Fathers are making headway with their fierce and political rap meets experimental rock and dance, like a more ragged Massive Attack, but are much more beloved of critics than listeners. Raye, well, you know how I feel about her. Should win: Raye. Will win: my heart says Raye, my nerves say Blur.",
            "CMAT is menacing the red carpet",
            "The Irish singer-songwriter, who’s letting it all hang out tonight, mischievously commented on “the craic” – or should that be “crack”? She said of her nomination that it “feels like someone is doing a practical joke”, and when interviewer Jack Saunders recalled her playing a literal practical joke on him involving a flower, she quipped “I squirted you with my ring.”",
            "CMAT thinks she has no hope of winning – “I’m up against Kylie Minogue” – but if she does, Brits organisers might just have a full-blown panic attack.",
            "Am I now rooting for her? Maybe.",
            "Will Miley and Taylor triumph tonight?",
            "Neil says: “International Song of the Year has to go to Miley Cyrus for Flowers, surely? It came out at the start of 2023 and I’m still humming it today. All together now: “I can buy myself flowers, write my name in the sand …” Should win: Miley Cyrus. Will win: Miley Cyrus.",
            "“International Group of the Year candidates are veteran pop punkers Blink 182, supergroup of singer-songwriters Boygenius, Dave Grohl’s popular rabble-rousers Foo Fighters, electro-gospel-soul trio Gabriels, and fierce post-emo rockers Paramore. Do groups really matter any more in today’s music environment? Well, these ones all make a good account of themselves but Boygenius are the ones who tapped into the pulse of the age. Should Win: Boygenius. Will win: Boygenius.",
            "“International Artist of the Year: lots of contenders here from across the musical spectrum. Afropop champions Asake and Burna Boy had fantastic years bringing new sounds into the pop mainstream, Caroline Polachek is an outstanding artist making work that is shaping the future parameters of pop, CMAT is an audacious Irish alternative singer-songwriter, Kylie needs no introductions, Lana Del Rey has created a whole genre of her own, SZA has been burning it up on the future RnB front, and Miley Cyrus and Olivia Rodrigo have nailed the pop hits. But let’s face it, it’s Taylor Swift’s world right now, we all just live in it. Should win: Caroline Polachek. Will win: Taylor Swift.",
            "The Brits runners and riders",
            "Neil shares his predictions: “Starting with the genre categories – and it looks like Raye could be in with an early shout for RnB Act, although she is also nominated for Pop Act. Is there a difference these days? The other RnB nominees Cleo Sol, Jorja Smith, Mahalia and mysterious collective SAULT. All talented, all deserving. I’d give it to SAULT, just to see who they send to collect it. But I suspect Raye might have this one in the bag. Should win: SAULT. Will win: Raye.",
            "“Raye is also nominated for Pop Act, along with Calvin Harris, Charlie XCX, Dua Lipa and Olivia Dean. Three of them are performing tonight, so I’m guessing one of them has won. Dua Lipa looks like a good shout, but if Raye’s going to make a historic clean sweep she will have to see the Barbie girl off. Should win: Dua Lipa. Will win: Raye.",
            "“Dance Act nominees are Barry Can’t Swim, Becky Hill, Calvin Harris, Fred Again and Romy. Becky Hill usually wins this. Fred Again has been the mover and shaker in British dance music these past few years, popularising a new brand of uplifting house. Surely time to give him his Brits crown? Should win: Fred Again. Will win: Becky Hill.",
            "“Hip Hop/Grime/Rap Act is an interesting one. It wasn’t an outstanding year for UK rap, with lots of interesting single but only a few really accomplished albums. Central Cee has been the breakout star, and even registered in the US, so surely he is the man to beat. But J Hus is probably the genres most accomplished producer, Dave makes music that resonates deeply in British pop culture and Little Simz is, to my mind, the UK’s finest rapper, albeit her latest album was a very personal and slightly under-the-radar release.",
            "“Cassisdead is an offbeat veteran who has been releasing singles and Eps since 2005, but made his long playing debut with a very interesting sci-fi dystopian-themed concept album, Famous Last Words. Probably a bit obscure for the Brits though. Should Win: Cassisdead. Will win: Central Cee.",
            "“Alternative/Rock Act. The nominees are Blur, Bring Me The Horizon and The Rolling Stones, who could all potentially win, plus alternative rap trio Young Fathers and jazz drummer Yussef Dayes (not quite sure what he’s doing here, but he’s great live). Sentimentally, I’d love to see the salty dogs in the Stones win something, but Britpop heroes Blur have staged the great comeback of the year. Should win: The Rolling Stones. Will win: Blur.”",
            "Who is definitely winning?",
            "“There’s four we already know,” explains Neil. “Kylie Minogue is getting the Global Icon award. No arguments there. She’s a pop superstar who has been having a fantastic year with her resurgent hit Padam Padam, excellent Tension album and a thrilling Vegas show. Whatever else happens, Kylie should end the night in glorious style.",
            "“Last Dinner Party have been given the Rising Star award, and they are definitely the most exciting British band around at the moment, a gang of unruly women making flamboyant art rock that marries Roxy Music and Arcade Fire, but in much nicer frocks.” Incidentally, the band just received their award from St Vincent on the ITV2 show.",
            "“Chase and Status have been named producers of the year. The crowd pleasing electronic duo have been making banging records for long to warrant admiration, so fair enough, albeit actual producers who spend their lives making records for other artists might have a justifiable grump about that.",
            "“Raye has been named Songwriter of the Year. I guess it guarantees that the most-nominated artist of the evening at least has a reason to turn up. And she is a very talented songwriter, a gifted pianist and outstanding singer whose music manages to be shinily modern yet full of classic retro depths, with lyrics that engage wittily and passionately with serious issues. She’s a top talent and in my opinion she deserves to win every category tonight. Even the ones she’s not nominated for. Just give her the lot and get it over with!”",
            "Who’s ready for Padam plus?",
            "“What a miracle it is,” says Raye of her multiple Brits nominations as the red carpet chat continues. She adds that winning Songwriter of the Year ahead of time took the pressure off and “is a beautiful thing”, although she admits to nerves for her upcoming performance.",
            "Kylie promises “Padam plus” for her show-closing Brits performance (YES).",
            "Breakthrough artist Olivia Dean, who has three nominations, is pleased to note that her purple dress matches the Brits trophy – good omen? We’ll soon find out.",
            "Revenge time for Raye",
            "“It should be a huge night for Raye, which would be a good thing,” says Neil. “I’m a big fan. Her debut album, My 21st Century Blues, was my album of the year, and she played some of the best shows I saw all year. I thought she should have won the Mercury Prize last year, and she should definitely win big at the Brits. The narrative of being dropped by a major record company and then becoming the most garlanded artist at the British music business awards is too juicy to resist.",
            "“If Raye does win big at the Brits tonight, it might make some in the business nervous. ‘I hope that one day, you know, I can even win an award in front of like all the music industry,’ Raye told me when I interviewed her last year, before adding: ‘Then I can really say some s---.’”",
            "Neil has some interesting thoughts ahead of tonight’s ceremony. “OK, here we go again. Brushing down my best suit for the British music business’s propaganda parade, where (in a triumph of optimism over experience) we hope that the deserving music will win awards, the unworthy will be left weeping in their champagne glasses, the comedians’ jokes will land, the viewers will be dazzled by outrageously choreographed performances, and Britain will at least momentarily be able to convince itself it is a global pop superpower. Is that too much to ask? (Don’t answer that)",
            "“I have to admit I am a little bit underwhelmed by the advertised bill of performers tonight. There are some obvious attractions. Dua Lipa is the UK star of the moment, and always puts on a slickly choreographed production. Kylie Minogue, basking in the glow of her Global Icon Award, is sure to be a treat. And with her record breaking seven-nominations to live up to, Raye is surely gonna be a show-stopping blast.",
            "“But that’s it for the heavy-hitters. No disrespect to the other talented performers (fantastic groovers Jungle, electronic shouters Chase and Status with dance queen Becky Hill, superproducer Calvin Harris with big-voiced Ellie Goulding, energetic Canadian pop starlet Tate McRae and, er, Nigerian rapper Rema) but they are going to have their work cut out to keep a mainstream TV audience glued to their screens. We could have done with a blast of Blur, The Rolling Stones or Bring Me the Horizon to raise the rock temperature and name recognition quotient.",
            "“The Brits is effectively primetime televised advertorial for UK music, promoted with maximum glitter and bombast, albeit it is hard to escape the feeling that it is all window dressing when so few British artists are currently having genuine commercial impact beyond these shores. Looking at the list of this year’s BRITS nominees, some would struggle to sell out a small theatre tour, whilst Britain’s actual superstars have mostly been disregarded.",
            "“Somehow, the ever-shifting makeup of the voting academy (tinkered with every year to reflect various concerns of inclusivity) resulted in there being no meaningful nominations for a handful of UK stars with genuine global reach – Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, Blur and those salty dogs The Rolling Stones. It is hard to get the balance right, but the Brits has to find a way to acknowledge status and success alongside artistic accomplishments.”",
            "Dua Lipa has entered the chat",
            "In other words, the red carpet interviews have kicked off on ITV2, with Dua Lipa politely answering some cheerfully insane questions.",
            "She promises “a spectacle” and “a party” in her Brits performance. More revelations as we get them.",
            "We have a new red carpet queen",
            "Says Tamara: “Wow. Maya Jama just stole the show. We can all go home now.”",
            "Tamara is also loving this daring choice from our favourite football pundit. “This is a great look on Alex Scott. Celebrity midriffs are everywhere these days, but this dress is original.”",
            "Who says men don’t have fun on the red carpet?",
            "“Not Aitch,” says Tamara, “in his tiger-like jacket and brown trousers.” Roar.",
            "She adds: “Jacob Collier’s colour-blocked look is so fun. The utilitarian cut of the jacket keeps it modern.”",
            "Elsewhere, let’s salute a practical nominee. “Little Simz is perhaps the only person who actually dressed for the weather, in an olive trench and fluffy pink hat.”",
            "And finally, here is the UK’s Eurovision hopeful. “Olly Alexander is wearing a vintage Alexander McQueen coat from 1997, which was part of the V&A Savage Beauty exhibition.”",
            "Kylie is spinning around",
            "At least, that’s how I think she lost one of her doily leg warmers.",
            "Tamara’s more sensible verdict: “Kylie’s strapless ensemble features a sculpted hip and ruffled leg. Not an easy look to attempt but she nails it.”",
            "Also, Tamara is delighted that Annie Mac is on trend. “She’s rocking the Telegraph Fashion Desk-approved red socks look.”",
            "For lucky VIP guests of the Warner Brits afterparty hosted at the five-star Nomad hotel in Covent Garden (Dua Lipa, Kylie, Maya Jama, Rio Ferdinand among them), a goodie bag worth an eye-watering £7,000 will be theirs for the banking.",
            "What could it possibly include, you ask? Well, highlights are: dinner for two at the Nomad Hotel, an annual Everyman cinema membership, a membership at the Ned’s Vault bar (with £500 credit), limited edition necklaces from Philip and Charlotte Colbert, an appointment for Cryotherapy and Biohacking, as well as various luxury skincare experiences and products.",
            "Raye has made her grand entrance",
            "The singer is “wearing a black embellished gown with a Bardot neckline,” says Tamara. Very classy.",
            "Going a different way... “Leopard print is back, and Abbey Clancey is wasting no time telling us. Animal print king Roberto Cavalli is behind her look,” reports Tamara.",
            "The girls strike back",
            "Last year, the Brits got into hot water after they switched to gender-neutral categories – and wound up with an all-male nominees list for Best Artist. The 2024 list for that category has been extended from five to 10 nominees (a slightly weaselly solution), and women have the slight edge, nabbing six of those slots.",
            "But with the likes of Raye, Dua Lipa, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus leading the charge, the Brits will surely reflect what has been a sensational year for female artists.",
            "Not all heroes wear capes",
            "...some wear psychedelic cape-dresses. “Jessie Ware’s iridescent look is all drama – the kind of look that makes her seem like she’s having the most fun on the red carpet tonight,” proclaims Tamara.",
            "Also looking Strictly fabulous: former ballroom queen Oti Mabuse. Tamara says: “She made the most of those dancer’s legs with a neon minidress and sandals that laced up to the thigh.",
            "Kylie and Raye will be performing",
            "In fact, we’re getting eight acts in all tonight. You can also expect live performances from Dua Lipa, Tate McRae, Jungle, Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, Rema, and Becky Hill with Chase & Status.",
            "Rapper Aitch is definitely Team Kylie.",
            "Who are you looking forward to watching? Let us know in the comments below!",
            "Someone’s missing a Dalmatian",
            "Tamara says: “Isla Fisher doesn’t do much in the way of red carpets, but when she does, she does it well. This polka dot look is by Monique Lhuillier.”",
            "A reality star also caught Tamara’s eye. “Made in Chelsea’s Sophie Habboo is wearing a two-tone dress by Nafsika Skourti,” she reports.",
            "Also impressing is the presenter and former Saturdays singer. “Mollie King’s cropped white blazer and slinky silver skirt is a great take on red carpet dressing,” enthuses Tamara.",
            "So, who is Raye?",
            "The 26-year-old Londoner (real name Rachel Keen) – and seven-time nominee tonight – has had an extraordinary journey even by the bumpy standards of the music biz. Her label Polydor stubbornly refused to release her debut album, and eventually released her from her contract.",
            "But boy has Raye had the last laugh. She scored a number one with single Escapism, and self-funded her soulful 2023 album My 21st Century Blues – which then became a massive critical and commercial success (and the Telegraph’s album of the year). Read Neil’s brilliant review of Raye here.",
            "Dua Lipa is making a splash",
            "The singer is nominated for three awards tonight – and she’s definitely winning the red carpet. Tamara adds: “Dua Lipa is also doing the leather look this evening.”",
            "Why do giraffes have long necks?",
            "Well in this case: so comedian Rob Beckett can plug his new tour, Giraffe. Brass neck, more like.",
            "Also turning heads is Irish singer CMAT, nominated for International Artist of the Year. Bottoms up?",
            "Traitor or faithful?",
            "Mollie Pearce, star of The Traitors’ outrageously good second season, has recovered from THAT betrayal and is now a glam lady in red.",
            "Meanwhile, Tamara salutes a trailblazer. “Fleur East has taken maternity dressing to the next level in this jumpsuit and cape look.”",
            "And tragically Olivia Attwood forgot her gym kit, so she’ll have to do the Brits in her pants.",
            "Giving new meaning to statuesque",
            "...is this mystery guest, who came dressed as the Brit Awards statue – or, as I first thought, a weirdly sexy chess piece.",
            "Kylie is already a winner",
            "The pint-sized Australian pop princess, who gifted us with yet another dance craze in the form of Padam Padam, is the recipient of this year’s Brits Global Icon award. Taylor Swift picked up this prestigious gong in 2021.",
            "Other awards that have already been announced include Raye winning Songwriter of the Year, and rockers The Last Dinner Party picking up the Rising Star award.",
            "Speaking of which, the latter are on the carpet – and Tamara approves. “The Last Dinner Party, aka Emily Roberts, Abigail Morris, Aurora Nishevci, Georgia Davies and Lizzie Mayland, succeeded in doing coordinated dressing without looking twee.”",
            "Upstairs, downstairs",
            "“Actress Joanne Froggatt looks worlds away from her Downton Abbey days in a leather cutaway gown by Tarik Ediz,” says Tamara.",
            "It might be a record-breaking night for Raye, who has a whopping seven nominations – including for Artist, Song and Album of the Year. The current record of Brits won at a single ceremony is jointly held by Blur, Adele and Harry Styles, with four a-piece.",
            "Her competition includes Little Simz, Young Fathers, Blur, Dua Lipa, Arlo Parks, J Hus, Ed Sheeran, and Jessie Ware.",
            "The international nominees feature some huge names – Taylor Swift, anyone? – and a song tipped for an Oscar next weekend, Billie Eilish’s Barbie ballad What Was I Made For?. Plus the likes of Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Ray, Olivia Rodrigo, SZA, Doja Cat, and Tate McRae.",
            "Spice up your life",
            "“Tallia Storm paid homage to the infamous Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell (now Horner) to the Brits in 1997, when she was a member of the Spice Girls,” reports Tamara Abraham.",
            "And there’s more fabulous eccentricity to come.",
            "“Fashion designer Dame Zandra Rhodes, famous for her pink hair, proved more is more in a metallic printed gown of her own design, a bold pendant necklace and gold sandals. Somehow, it all looks sensational.”",
            "Glamour – and gloves – on the red carpet",
            "Speaking of fashion... Tamara Abraham is impressed by some of the Brits’ stylish early birds. “Laura Whitmore was one of the first to arrive in an asymmetric black Azzi & Osta gown, slit to the thigh with crystal hoops across the neckline and sleeve.”",
            "She adds: “Former Pussycat Doll and Strictly star Ashley Roberts wore a white, draped Grecian-inspired halterneck gown.",
            "“Television presenter Zara McDermott went for old Hollywood glamour in a burgundy lace gown, completed by matching opera gloves – a trend that’s been embraced by the Princess of Wales.",
            "“Singer Rebecca Ferguson went for a tweed belted skirt suit, completed by white Mary-Janes and, yes, more gloves. They may well be a theme this evening.”",
            "Where are the Brits this year?",
            "The ceremony is coming to us from the O2 Arena in London, once again, hosted by Clara Amfo, Maya Jama, and Roman Kemp. Yinka Bokinni and Jack Saunders will be conducting red carpet interviews.",
            "Of course, the only question we really need answered is: can anyone possibly top Sam Smith’s insane fetish-bin-bag-Teletubbies fashion disaster from 2023? God I hope so.",
            "Hello and welcome",
            "…to the 2024 Brit Awards! I’m Marianka Swain, and we’ll be bringing you all the live action from the music industry’s big night, from bizarre red carpet attire through to the performances and winners.",
            "The Telegraph’s discerning music critic Neil McCormick is standing by to offer his expert commentary, and you can watch along with us: the red carpet interviews are on ITV2 from 7:30pm, and the actual ceremony begins at 8:30pm on ITV1 and ITVX.",

            "A last-gasp goal from Aston Villa substitute Lucas Digne denied Luton Town what would have been a huge point in their fight for Premier League survival and gave Unai Emery’s men a big Champions League boost.",
            "Rob Edwards’ brave team looked to have an impossible task on their hands at half-time, trailing to two Ollie Watkins goals. The striker had also hit the post and Villa should have been out of sight.",
            "But, despite being without a host of injured players and facing a mountain to climb, Luton never gave up in front of their biggest crowd in over 30 years.",
            "Goals from Tahith Chong and Carlton Morris looked to have secured a dramatic point that could have been so valuable at the end of the season, particularly with Everton and Nottingham Forest both losing.",
            "But Digne broke Luton’s hearts right at the death with a goal from the cross of another late substitute, Moussa Diaby, that preserved fourth-placed Villa’s five-point cushion over Tottenham Hotspur.",
            "A dejected Edwards said: “As you can imagine, we’re down. It’s hard to come out after a defeat, but I feel we don’t deserve to based on the performance. It’s really difficult to take right now. It’s probably the angriest I’ve been and it hurts.",
            "“I’ll struggle to sleep tonight, but I will sleep better knowing we have given everything. We need to pick ourselves up.”",
            "Watkins could have had a hat-trick in the first half, as he netted his 15th and 16th League goals of the season and struck the post. He trails the League’s top scorer Erling Haaland by a single goal and the Norwegian is the only other top-flight player with more than 30 goal contributions across all competitions this season.",
            "Asked if Watkins is currently one of the best strikers in Europe, Emery said: “Yes, of course. The Premier League is the toughest in the world and he’s been amazing. But as a person, he’s humble and he doesn’t let it change him. Fantastic, brilliant, he’s an example for other players.”",
            "Watkins is making himself impossible for England manager Gareth Southgate not to take to the European Championships and Emery added: “He deserves to be there in the national team. He deserves to be there.”",
            "Jacob Ramsey threatened twice during the opening 15 minutes, but after that Watkins took over. Thomas Kaminski saved well midway through the first half to keep out the former Brentford man, who had been given a sight of goal by Leon Bailey. But the Luton goalkeeper was beaten from the resulting corner, as Watkins brilliantly headed in Bailey’s set piece.",
            "Villa co-owner Nassef Sawiris was watching from the Kenilworth Road directors’ box and celebrated wildly when Watkins’ header hit the back of the net.",
            "Having hit a post, Watkins doubled Villa’s lead after he beat the Luton offside trap and the linesman, who flagged for offside when the striker had clearly been onside.",
            "Reece Burke was booked for pulling the shirt of Morgan Rogers, Douglas Luiz took a quick free-kick and Watkins finished smartly past Kaminski. The linesman initially ruled the goal out with his flag for offside, but VAR showed he had clearly been on and the goal was given.",
            "Luton came out for the second half a different team, pinning Villa back and winning set piece after set piece that the visitors could barely cope with.",
            "The home side finally made one of their corners count in the 66th minute. Alfie Doughty’s corner wasn’t dealt with by the Villa defence and after Matt Cash had produced a brilliant headed block on the goalline to stop Burke, Chong scored from close range.",
            "Seven minutes later, Luton levelled from yet another set-piece, this time conceded by Ezri Konsa. Doughty produced another superb delivery and Morris guided his shot past Emi Martinez to send the home fans wild.",
            "Emery signalled for calm from the visiting dug-out, but he made a quadruple change with just over 10 minutes remaining - sending on Digne, Diaby, Nicolo Zaniolo and Tim Iroegbunam.",
            "It was two of the substitutes who combined to win the game for Villa and send Emery leaping down the touchline in celebration. Diaby crossed from the right and Digne timed his run perfectly at the back post to head in from close range.",
            "Luton Town 2 Aston Villa 3: As it happened",
            "Watkins on his form",
            "I feel like my game understanding has gotten a lot better, my movement. Also conserving energy. I was pressing because I can do that, but sometimes when I do get the chance to go through on goal I can be a bit tired from chasing defenders. Also the mentality, knowing that if I miss a chance I’m going to bury the next one, which I didn’t have before.",
            "Ollie Watkins on Villa’s rough second half",
            "We know with their previous results they score a lot of late goals and the fans get behind them. It’s a difficult place to go.",
            "We had the same instance with Forest last week. We were a little bit to comfortable and too relaxed which is the worst thing you can do at two goals up.",
            "I think we needed to stay on the ball a lot more, and use the goalkeeper.",
            "FT: Luton 2 Villa 3",
            "Unai Emery punches the air at the end, three points pulled from the fire just when it looked like two were being dropped. Villa were completely superior for 45 minutes when Watkins terrorised Luton’s defence, before evaporating for much of the second half and conceding two set-piece goals. A moment of quality between Diaby and Digne saved the day in the 90th minute. The win keeps Villa five points clear of Spurs, who travel to Villa Park next Sunday (albeit Spurs have a game in hand). That could be a pivotal game.",
            "95 minutes: Luton 2 Villa 3",
            "Villa look to have just done enough, but there is time for one more Luton set-piece after Cash and Konsa slice clearances in their own box. Doughty across to take from the right with his left foot and Mengi was up early! But his header flew over the bar.",
            "90 minutes: Luton 2 Villa 3",
            "Rob Edwards looked furious with his team’s defending, even though he will be delighted with their second-half performance. Villa fans are the supporters you can hear signing now. Potentially a big moment in the season with Ajax and Spurs to come this week.",
            "GOOAAAALL! Villa may well have got themselves out of jail",
            "Two of Emery’s subs combine, with Diaby clipping a cross to the back post with his left foot and Digne stole in ahead of Ogbene to squeeze a header under Kaminski.",

            "84 minutes: Luton 2 Villa 2",
            "Chong has picked up a knock for Luton, and Ruddock Mpanzu has replaced him, the player who has been with Luton from non-League all the way up the pyramid. Luton have yet another free-kick which Doughty is going to whip in.",
            "It was almost a carbon copy of the goal! Morris’ side-footed the ball right across the six-yard box but the flag was up for offside anyway.",
            "80 minutes: Luton 2 Villa 2",
            "Barkley with quick feet in midfield again to win a free-kick, which looked to be heading towards Morris again before it was turned behind for a corner. This time it is straight down Martinez’s throat. Diaby’s speed threatens on the break but his low cross is cut out.",
            "78 minutes: Luton 2 Villa 2",
            "Emery is about to make a raft of attacking subs, although perhaps he should not have waited until the game was level. Diaby, Digne, Zaniolo and Iroegbunam are on for Bailey, Moreno, Tielemans and Rogers. I thought Rogers did very well considering his lack of minutes, feels a bit harsh.",
            "74 minutes: Luton 2 Villa 2",
            "There is no visible sign of a Villa response. Momentum has shifted and Luton are pouring forward in numbers. This time Barkley clipped a cross to the back post, and it was a mismatch of Morris vs Cash in the air, but he did not connect with the header,",
            "GOOOOAAALLL! Luton level through Morris",
            "Luton have stacked up the set-pieces in this half and it has paid dividends. It is a superb delivery looped from left to right by Doughty, and there is Morris to direct the ball home with a well-controlled, side-foot volley. Great composure from the Luton striker. Villa in danger of throwing points away.",
            "69 minutes: Luton 1 Villa 2",
            "Unai Emery’s managerial career has been studded with games in which they sink back trying to defend a lead and end up being punished. Villa were so superior in the first half, but have been pushed back and muted since the restart. Luton have rebalanced and are flying.",
            "GOOOOAALL! Chong has pulled one back for Luton",
            "Finally, Luton make one of their set-pieces count. It was a mad scramble once the ball was headed back across goal, with Matty Cash heading off the line, but Chong finally forced the ball over the line. Cash and team-mates may have done well to avoid a handball and red card on the line. Game on.",
            "66 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Good football from Luton, with Barkley spreading play out to Kabore. The ball was set back to Ogbene, and Lenglet had to slice the ball behind for a corner. Could he have let the ball run for Martinez?",
            "62 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Another Luton corner claimed by Emi Martinez, although this one was far more straightforward. The home fans remain in good voice but an uptick in their performance has so far not yielded a goal.",
            "59 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Villa have not really got started in this half, failing to keep the ball and inviting pressure. Luton pushing forward does mean there will be space for Watkins on the break though. You can’t help but wonder if Luton needed a goal from one of that flurry of set-pieces.",
            "57 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Much, much better from Luton, and Villa are guilty of conceding set-pieces around their box. This time it was Cash on Chong near the left-hand corner of the box. At the back post, Morris loops a header on to the roof of the net.",
            "54 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Rob Edwards is about to give Hashioka a Premier League debut from the bench. Luton have won another corner, which Doughty is going to whip in with his left peg. Excellent take from Martinez, under pressure and at an awkward angle. It’s good goalkeeping from Martinez, who then stays down nursing his back to kill a few more seconds.",
            "51 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Luton turning up the pressure. McGinn is at full stretch to deal with Chong, and turns the ball behind for a corner. These set-pieces are stacking up at the start of the second half, but Villa are standing strong and dealing with the aerial challenges.",
            "49 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Rogers has been very impressive since coming on for Villa, comfortable receiving the ball in pockets of space between the Luton midfield and defence. This time he feeds Watkins, but that striker’s shot was tame. Then Rogers is shown a yellow card for a foul on Kabore. Another Luton free-kick in a dangerous area.",
            "47 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Better from Luton with Kabore winning a free-kick down the right, but no orange shirt could make contact with the delivery. Luton trying to be more positive at the start of this half.",
            "We are back under way in the second half",
            "Luton have scored plenty of late goals this season, and they need a few more.",
            "HT: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "A routine half from Villa, who have made light work of a trip to Kenilworth Road so far. Emery’s team have moved the ball smoothly, and Ollie Watkins has been electric. Aside from his two goals, he has given an under-strength Luton defence kittens with his movement and (possibly underrated) hold up play.",
            "45+7 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Bailey pulled him with a knock on the edge of Villa’s defensive third, causing McGinn to dive in and give away a free-kick. A little better from Luton in stoppage time, Villa getting a little sloppy. Barkley is over it...22 yards out, left of centre but he cannot beat the wall.",
            "45+4 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "McGinn feeds the ball into the feet of Watkins again, and Luton are scrambling back to defend. Luton are hampered by injuries but this has been far too easy for the visitors in this half.",
            "Another booking for a Villa player, Leon Bailey the offender this time stopping the counter-attack.",
            "45 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Douglas Luiz has been shown his seventh yellow card of the season, somewhat harshly for a nothing incident down the Villa right. The free-kick gives Luton the chance to deliver into the box, and Morris won a free header before Chong’s shot was charged down by Moreno.",
            "There will be SEVEN minutes of added time to play.",
            "44 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Rogers has looked positive and imposing since coming on for Villa, and he draws a superb save from Kaminski to keep out a shot that was bending towards the top corner. Villa looking slick.",
            "43 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 2",
            "Villa’s comfort from the first whistle is now reflected in the scoreline. A bit more pressure on this game after Spurs’ comeback win earlier today. Also looks a presentable chance to extend the lead over Man Utd, who play at the Etihad tomorrow. Villa host Spurs next week.",
            "GOOOAAALL! Watkins has his second",
            "That is why you stay serious and put the ball in the net, regardless of what the linesman is doing. It’s a lovely finish from Watkins, but Luton knocked off at the restart. Watkins now has 16 Premier League goals this season.",
            "38 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 1",
            "Villa have the ball in the net but the flag has gone up for offside against Watkins. Burke was shown a yellow card for pulling back Rogers, and Luiz took a quick one through to Watkins. Smart finish, and this is a very tight offside call.",
            "VAR checking...I think the Luton player in the left-back position has played him onside.",
            "35 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 1",
            "Ollie Watkins skims the foot of the post! Villa ever so close to taking a two-goal lead. It was classic Watkins, a run down the side of the centre-halves before shifting and shooting across Kaminski. Watkins looks a class above those Luton defenders.",
            "32 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 1",
            "Wicked delivery from McGinn, and inswinger with his left foot, but Lenglet could not get his head around the glancing header. The Villa defender then ushers the ball behind for a goal kick at the other end. Luton have another injury headache, although Mengi is back on having gone off holding his foot.",
            "30 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 1",
            "Jacob Ramsey is not fully over the problem with his left foot, and has been substituted. Morgan Rogers has replaced him, a 21-year-old with just two substitute appearances in the Premier League.",
            "26 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 1",
            "Luton have not been able to pen Villa in so far, there has always been an out-ball, and it is usually Watkins. This has been a textbook away performance at a tricky ground from Emery’s team. Putting their foot on the ball, quieting the crowd as well as carrying a threat.",
            "GOOOAAALLL! Watkins gives Villa the lead",
            "Ollie Watkins has been threatening that since the first few minutes, but you would not have expected it to come from a corner. It’s a fairly basic piece of movement to the near post but it was untracked, and Watkins’ glancing header left Kaminski with no chance.",
            "22 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "Kaminski called into action to claim Bailey’s driven cross from the right, but his handling was clean. And then the Luton goalkeeper produced a better stop to deny Watkins, standing tall as the Villa striker tried to find the roof of the net. Watkins looking really sharp so far.",
            "20 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "One of the problems facing Luton at the moment is that Doughty, one of their most productive attackers this season, has had to move back and cover the left centre-back area. It is curtailing his bursts forward. Watkins with some excellent hold up play helps his team move up the pitch again.",
            "17 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "Ramsey is fit to continue. Villa pass the ball across their own penalty area from right to left under Luton pressure, but once again they find a way out with a clipped ball to Watkins. Luton yet to fashion a dangerous attacking moment.",
            "14 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "Emiliano Martinez claims a Townsend cross with ease, to cheers from the away fans. At the other end, the ball runs through into Ramsey’s path after good work by McGinn and Kaminski tips his curling shot around the post. Now Ramsey is down nursing some kind of knock and the physios are on.",
            "11 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "Villa have settled well in possession, Luton struggling to apply that suffocating pressure that can be a theme of games at Kenilworth Road.

            "7 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "This is hard work for Luton’s defence, who are struggling to cope with the peeling runs of Watkins, Ramsey and Bailey. Villa are turning them early and causing stress. Luton try to get going as an attacking force, but the flag goes up against them for offside.",
            "5 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "Luton are missing some key defensive personnel and they are looking ragged in the first few minutes. Mengi did well to step across and deal with a burst forward from Ramsey.",
            "Yet another injury problem here for them. Amari’i Bell has pulled up with what looks a hamstring injury. Ogbene, a much more attacking player, is going to replace him. It could mean Kabore inside and Ogbene as a wing-back.",
            "2 minutes: Luton 0 Villa 0",
            "Aston Villa backing themselves to pass out from deep areas on a tight pitch, and they released Watkins down the right. He found Bailey on the overlap, whose cross glanced off the chest of Jacob Ramsey. Lively start from the visitors.",

            "More than 30 million Americans have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, which can cause sufferers to choke and gasp dozens of times per hour as they sleep. As a person ages, the effects of the disorder often get worse.",
            "A 2022 study found patients with sleep apnea have a 43% higher risk of developing any type of neurocognitive disorder, a 28% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 54% higher risk of Parkinson’s disease.",
            "“People with sleep apnea who spend less time in deep sleep are more likely to have brain health problems that could lead to dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or a stroke, a new study shows,” WebMD wrote in May, citing a Journal of Sleep Research probe published in the medical journal Neurology.",
            "The study compared people with amyloid plaques in the brain, an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. “We found that people with amyloid plaques who had more severe sleep apneas also were more likely to have lower volumes in the medial temporal lobe area of the brain, including the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease,” lead author Geraldine Rauch wrote.",
            "Researchers say the sleep apnea link with dementia is probably caused by the brain being starved of oxygen during sleep, which can damage blood vessels and lead to the development of plaque.",
            "Dr. O’Connor noted that Mr. Biden had difficulty adjusting to the PAP mask. “This is reasonably anticipated and, in fact, should be expected. … But with trials of several different masks, we have been able to identify a couple of products which fit him very comfortably and effectively,” the doctor said.",
            "In addition to sleep apnea, the physical revealed Mr. Biden suffers from an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, which drastically raises the risk of stroke. The president has suffered from the condition since 2003, and Dr. O’Connor says he continues to take the blood thinner apixaban, brand name Eliquis, to treat the heart condition.",

I’ve never felt compelled to hand over cash to someone to take a knife to my face or my body with the specific aim of altering it into something that may not resemble the body I’ve grown up with. I don’t, however, have any issues with anyone who does. We all have a different relationship with our bodies: some of us love what our DNA created, but some of us don’t. And, again, both scenarios are okay.",
            "But even as a grown-ass woman who’s fairly confident within herself, on seeing women with incredible bodies, oozing healthy lifestyles on Instagram, I often sigh – because it’s a reminder of what I don’t have body-wise since having two kids in fairly quick succession later on in life. It’s never impacted me enough that I’ll do something drastic about it, but I do have those blips where I look in the mirror and am not particularly over the moon about the body staring back at me. Those moments are rare though – I’m generally cool with what I’ve got.",

And the owners of those bodies hadn’t been honest about it.",

            "Firstly, these women had clearly been given a huge boost in confidence as a result of the changes in their bodies. Their joy is so evident, it’s beautiful to witness. That happiness and comfort within themselves had probably been a big part of why I was following their content. They were no longer hiding themselves, and I know I’m not the only follower or fan to have noticed. But, with such a large number of women enjoying their content, should they have been honest about the work they had done? Therein lies the question.",
            "Part of me believes that they shouldn’t. It’s a very personal decision, so why should they announce it to thousands of people they have never met? It should be nobody else’s business.",
            "However, when we’re consuming so much content about other people’s lives, participating in “comparison culture” can happen without you even realising. It’s an easy road for some to go down, feeling as though they’re failing in some way because they haven’t managed to achieve a certain look no matter how hard they try, when someone else appears to have done it with great ease. However, as I learned recently, the ease isn’t always down to hours spent in the gym, but the incision of a surgeon’s knife. Essentially, it’s a look that’s unachievable without funds.",
            "The added layer to unpack is when gym content invariably starts popping up on those influencers’ feeds, giving the impression that it was secret hours spent in the gym that triggered the body transformation. As I now realise, the gym work is to maintain the effect of surgery, rather than the cause.",
            "It’s tricky, isn’t it? It’s a conversation I had recently with my Loose Women colleague Olivia Attwood-Dack, who has spoken honestly about the work she’s had done. She believes that men and women should not feel as though they have to be honest about it, but understands the impact being silent can have on others. It’s not a cut-and-dried argument.",
            "Irrespective of all this, what I love above everything else is honesty. Candice Brathwaite has kept her followers abreast of her health transformation for a while now, achieved through daily runs on a treadmill and different food choices, which she has documented. I’ve loved watching her journey, as through her honesty one can fully understand what’s really needed when you want to make changes not just to your health, but also to your wellbeing. If we can have more of that, and less of the cloak and dagger, perhaps more people will find that joy. I do hope so."

            "The pastor recruited people who visited his compound by “love-bombing” them and persuading them that he was “a representative for God on Earth”, Rae told i. They were told to call him “daddy” and always be loyal to him.",
            "“Once he got that in place he would then start knocking you down and let you know the areas of yourself that weren’t pleasing or acceptable,” she said, describing how she was put through rounds of “what I could consider conversion therapy” and was “regularly disgraced about the fact I was gay”.",
            "Under a system which Rae said was akin to “totalism”, followers underwent “thought reform” and within a week, “my mind was pretty much under the control of TB Joshua”.",
            "“I had abandoned friends, family, my former life,” said the 43-year-old, who now lives in Devon.",
            "She entered the cult at the age of 21. The accommodation was “super-basic”, with people sleeping on bunkbeds in dormitories where toilets were not private but only had a shower curtain as a door.",
            "Women were encouraged to walk around naked in the dormitory, while people were “drunk on lack of sleep” as they were not allowed more than three or fours a day. Meetings could be held at 3am despite people having allegedly worked most of the day in conditions akin to “modern-day slavery”.",
            "There was a “culture of forced reporting” of other disciples’ supposed wrongdoings, “to the degree where people would massively inflate any little thing just to carry favour with him.",
            "“People would lie, people would embarrass you, you are talking anything from somebody eating too long in the canteen to somebody being caught having a wank in the toilet.",
            "“It was really embarrassing stuff,” Rae said, adding that Joshua would often preplan the humiliations by forcing people into “coerced confessions”.",
            "Cult members were not allowed watches or phones, and internet use needed signed permission from Joshua, she added – and upon leaving the compound in 2013, she learned many people had tried to contact her over the years but she never received the emails.",
            "“We had police with AK-47s on the gates of the compound,” Rae said. While this may have been for safety reasons, the former disciple added: “Essentially you were trapped, all our passports were taken away, they were locked in a vault, we didn’t have access to them the entire time we were there.”",
            "‘I thought I was the sinner’",
            "Rae alleges she was one of many who were sexually assaulted by Joshua, with the abuse happening over a period of six months to a year. She says she had lost perception of time, but based on events that happened, she believes this was around 2003-2004.",
            "“There were several occasions within that period that he would phone me, call me to come up to his bedroom, assault, and then send me back down again,” she told i.",
            "Rae said her brainwashing meant she found justification in what Joshua allegedly did while blaming herself for it. “I very much felt like I was the sinner in the situation and even started questioning whether I was the cause of it. Did I have some evil spirit that had brought him down?”",
            "Eventually, she said, she was put in self-isolation for two years because she was still gay. This was not physical but it meant no one could talk to her and she was removed from work. She had a mental breakdown and tried to kill herself several times.",
            "“He’d prayed for me many many times and I was still gay and I was very very unhappy,” Rae added.",
            "However, while this was a punishment, “he kind of lost control of me” at this point, she explained, as Joshua knew about her suicidal thoughts and did nothing to help.",
            "The self-isolation led to a “crack in the armour”, which saw Rae regaining a “slight amount” of independent thinking.",
            "In 2013, during a work trip to Mexico, instead of returing to the compound, she decided to go back to her parents’ house in the UK as she did not feel Joshua had changed her sexuality or was likely to do so.",
            "“I realised that he had not been able to help me, I had been through several rounds of what I would consider conversion therapy, public deliverances over the course of time, and it became very apparent to me that I still had the same sex emotions towards women and this wasn’t going away.”",
            "Rae recalled the moment she realised that “maybe it wasn’t so bad to be gay” – while watching Ellen DeGeneres and seeing her happily married to her wife, Portia de Rossi.",
            "“I think, if it wasn’t for seeing the content from Ellen DeGeneres, I probably still would’ve stayed. It completely opened my mind to a different thought process. That particular thing was essentially what led me out of the place.",
            "“It’s quite ironic really. Being gay is what took me there and being gay is also what took me out and I am super-grateful for that.",
            "“I am not ashamed of anything related to who I am, I am a person, my gender and my orientation doesn’t make me any more or any less a person, it doesn’t make me who I am either, it’s just a part of me.”",
            "Rae accused the British Government of inaction over the alleged abuse of its citizens “trapped” in the cult under an “absolutely prolific rapist and predator”.",
            "She has claimed supposed welfare checks by the UK High Commission in Nigeria were inadequate, since UK citizens staying in the compound had been stripped of their passports and access to the outside world.",
            "She and other survivors have written to Foriegn Secretary Lord Cameron asking for him to confirm the Foreign Office will investigate allegations of wrongdoing against UK citizens, and pressure Nigerian authorities to close down Scoan. But she claims there was no response.",
            "A Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson told i: “We take all reports of crime, including sexual assault and violence against British nationals overseas, very seriously.",
            "“Our trained consular teams are contactable 24 hours a day, ready to offer support and advice to British nationals, including on how to report such crimes to the local authorities.",

            "[Working in one of the UK's 'dental deserts', a dentist providing urgent care reveals the agony of patients unable to access NHS appointments]",
            "When yet another person walks into Beth’s NHS urgent dental service after trying to remove their own teeth with pliers, she despairs. Not at the patients and what they’ve done to themselves, but at their agony caused by the shortage of NHS dentists.",
            "“That shouldn’t be happening; it’s awful,” says Beth, who has dealt with multiple “DIY” cases. “I can’t imagine how desperate people must be to do that, without anesthetic, when they don’t know what they’re doing.",
            "“During the pandemic, we saw the disasters that happen when people try DIY haircuts, but doing it with medical procedures is absolutely wild. In what other area of healthcare would people feel they have to attempt their own treatments? The situation is unacceptable.”",
            "Beth, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, works in NHS urgent care three days a week and at a private practice on the other two. Many of her shifts are spent performing emergency care to patients in evening clinics or at weekends.",
            "She often treats people – including children – who have barely any teeth left or need multiple extractions after being unable to see a general dentist. Based in the south-west of England, her area is a “dental desert”, where people can wait for years to enrol with an NHS practitioner.",
            "Nearly six million fewer courses of NHS dental treatment were provided in England in 2022/23, compared to the 38 million in the year before the pandemic. Scotland also has a problem, with people said to be travelling to Turkey and even as far as India for treatment.",
            "Across the UK, 22 per cent of people are not registered with a dentist, according to a YouGov poll last year. The health and social care select committee says this is “totally unacceptable”, but the problem is even worse in Beth’s county. “More than half the population are unregistered here,” she says.",
            "For some people, the results aren’t just painful, they’re fatal. The British Dental Association (BDA) fears that a decline in the availability of NHS dental services will “cost lives” to mouth cancer.",
            "The number of people who died from the disease in the UK in 2021 was up by 46 per cent from a decade earlier, according to figures obtained by the Oral Health Foundation.",
            "Around nine out of 10 sufferers survive at least five years when the disease is diagnosed early, but that typically requires regular dental check-ups. When it is spotted later, that survival rate drops to 50:50.",
            "“When I was in dental school,” says Beth, “I got the impression that I might see a couple of cases of oral cancer in my whole career. I’ve only been qualified for a few years, but already I’ve made six referrals that have resulted in cancer diagnoses.”",
            "She feels it is her duty to speak out about how so many unregistered patients in the UK are suffering and why she believes there is little sign of things improving, despite Government pledges.",
            "“What’s happening is shocking,” she says. “It’s awful and people need to know.”",
            "Three days of pain",
            "Saturday: Children with ruined mouths",
            "Today I was working in urgent out-of-hours care. Seeing emergency patients who don’t have a dentist gives me an insight into how the system is failing.",
            "These services are purely for people with severe problems that need immediate attention; things such as traumatic injuries, facial swellings or complications after surgery. We’re often double booked and have to stay late.",
            "The phones opened at 8.30am and our appointments were full within an hour. If more people call in, we sometimes send them to A&amp;E.",
            "I saw about 20 patients during the day. Two of them were children with severe facial swellings. One little boy was six years old and it was his first time seeing a dentist. He needed a tooth taken out. It’s hard enough for any child to be cooperative enough for us to do this, but it’s especially difficult when they’re so worried and unwell.",
            "We gave him an urgent referral to paediatrics at a community service, for the tooth to come out under general anaesthetic. But the waiting list is ridiculous. There are so many children on it, so before then we might see him as an emergency case again. And he might have other problems in the meantime – he had decay in almost every tooth.",
            "A few weekends ago, I saw a child who had just turned three. He had a case of “bottle caries”, where they’d been sleeping with a bottle in their mouth. This bathes teeth in milk and they can rot very quickly. This boy needed almost all of his teeth taking out under general anesthetic, leaving maybe four behind. His adult teeth won’t start to come through until he’s about seven, so he’ll start school with barely any teeth. That could affect his speech, his friendships – it’s a big deal. It sounds shocking, but you’d be surprised just how common it is.",
            "This is why we recommend a dental check-up for children before the age of one. Labour has suggested introducing supervised toothbrushing in schools if it wins the general election. I’d support anything that encourages children to brush their teeth more, because unfortunately there are neglectful parents out there – but often it’s too late by the time they’re in school. So would this have the desired effect? Probably not. And is it really the responsibility of teachers?",
            "NHS-funded dental services in England are in “widespread crisis” and “near-terminal decline”, according to the Nuffield Trust healthcare think-tank.",
            "In 2022, nine in every 10 NHS dental practices across the UK were not accepting new adult patients, a BBC investigation found.",
            "Even when NHS treatment is accessible, 61 per cent of people still find the treatments expensive, discouraging many from going to check-ups, according to one survey by Healthwatch.",
            "With facial swellings, often there’s an infection and an abscess around the tooth. Sometimes the swelling is so severe the patient can barely open their mouth more than a finger’s width. That stops us getting to the problem. It’s a medical emergency too, because they can’t eat and could choke if they vomit.",
            "I had a patient in his 30s with this problem. He had already received two different antibiotics and his mouth opening hadn’t improved. We’re supposed to avoid using antibiotics too much because of the increase in resistance, but if everyone had access to NHS dentists and abscesses were being prevented through check-ups, we wouldn’t need to prescribe them so often.",
            "This guy was unregistered and hadn’t seen a dentist in about a decade. He needs a full clearance – all his teeth being removed and a denture being fitted to replace them. We can refer him to a community service for the extractions, but getting a denture will be difficult.",
            "Right now, however, he needed to have his jaw prised open and the infected tooth taken out. We couldn’t find anyone to see him, so we sent him to A&amp;E. I called the hospital to let them know he was coming, but he still had to wait because they were so busy. His frustrations boiled over and he abused some of the staff, so they refused to treat him. All I could do was prescribe more antibiotics and some very strong pain relief and he’ll have to wait until the consultant is willing to see him again.",
            "Monday: Letting down the most vulnerable",
            "Today I saw another 20 unregistered patients. One of them came into our emergency dental centre two years ago with severe toothache. He needed root canal treatment back then to save one of his teeth, but we could only do the first stage. He needed a general dentist to complete the job.",
            "For that, of course, people need to find a dentist they can register with. Good luck.",
            "Quite often people come back to us having been unable to find anyone on the NHS, by which time their tooth has worsened and needs to come out. That’s what had happened with this man. He’s in a good job and understands oral hygiene, he isn’t vulnerable and hasn’t done anything wrong, but now he has an abscess. He was saying: ‘I’ll get it done privately,’ but he’ll need to find the money.",
            "Later, I saw an elderly gentleman for another extraction. We see him in emergency care every couple of years; he’ll have a tooth out and go off again. He’s down to only a few teeth now, but we have no provision to give him dentures. That massively impacts his life, including his nutrition. We’ve relieved his pain for now, but his underlying problems aren’t being resolved.",
            "The other day in the emergency clinic, I took out 18 teeth. That’s pretty standard. In the past couple of years, I must have done thousands of extractions. It’s sad because almost every one is preventable.",
            "I also saw a homeless man in his 30s. Every one of his teeth has rotted right down to the stump, so he’s living in constant pain. It’s from a history of drug abuse and being put onto methadone, which is terrible for teeth. He’s been suffering for years, unable to eat normal meals. Today he had eight extractions and it was the next stage of making his denture.",
            "A ‘special-care patient’ was brought in by his parents. We have to make referrals for people with severe physical or cognitive disabilities, who might be non-verbal and live in supported accommodation. He can’t tell anyone if he’s in pain, but his parents noticed the signs. He needs a general anesthetic, but the waiting lists are so atrocious. It’s our most vulnerable people in society who suffer.",
            "The NHS dental crisis shot into the national consciousness again last month when hundreds of people began queuing down a street in Bristol in the hope of registering with a newly-opened practice.",
            "Police had to manage the line, which reportedly included a disabled cancer sufferer, who could barely stand.",
            "Their wait continued the following day, apparently leading to a fight over someone jumping the queue, and even lasted into a third day before all places at St Pauls Dental Practice were filled.",
            "Among those in the queue was 66-year-old teacher Norman Stephenson, who revealed he had tried using superglue to repair his dentures.",
            "Tuesday: Cancer concerns",
            "A patient who hasn’t had a dentist for about a decade came in for an emergency appointment recently. She had some loose teeth, and when I lifted up her lip, she also had a suspicious lesion that I worried could be more serious. I asked her: ‘Have you not noticed the huge ulcer?’ She had no idea it was there. We made an urgent referral for her to be tested by a specialist within two weeks, and now her results have come back",
            "I was right: it’s oral cancer.",
            "It was really sad hearing that news.",
            "It’s one of the least treatable cancers unless it’s caught really early. But it’s also asymptomatic until it reaches a bad level – so unless you’re lucky, you need to be seeing a dentist regularly for it to be spotted in time. This is totally overlooked by politicians.",
            "Most people don’t often look at the back of their throats, underneath their tongue, right up under their lips. We encourage the public to do this, in the same way that they’re meant to check their breasts or testicles, but our mouths can look quite odd to people who aren’t experts.",
            "This woman was diagnosed at a late stage, so she’s definitely in danger.  She’s in her 60s, but it can affect people of any age. She had been on the NHS waiting list for years and only had about six teeth remaining, with no dentures to replace the missing ones, so she was already struggling with nutrition.",
            "Seeing a dentist is not just about improving our health, it’s potentially life-saving. I know of one person who was diagnosed with a form of mouth cancer after it was picked up early during a routine appointment. They had an operation and they survived.",
            "They could afford to be seen regularly as a private patient. Imagine if they weren’t so fortunate and couldn’t get an NHS appointment: they could be dead.",
            "It was quite a difficult day all round. Another patient I saw was a man in his 20s with severe toothache, who had rung for an ambulance the day before, only to be turned away from A&amp;E because they won’t deal with toothache. But he was crying when he came in – he said he’d even thought about suicide because of the sheer pain. Toothache can be one of the worst things we experience. We did an emergency extraction, but he still went away with other problems that ought to be treated.",
            "A poll of 500 dentists last month found that 82 per cent had seen patients who have “taken matters into their own hands since lockdown”, according to the BDA.",
            "The TV presenter Paddy McGuinness told <em>Question Time</em> last month that his father “took his own teeth out because he couldn’t get a dentist appointment”.",
            "The 87-year-old mother of Labour MP Grahame Morris tried her luck with pliers. “My mother is 87 and very frail,” he told Parliament in January. “She did this out of desperation. It is appalling.”",
            "Caroline Pursey, 63, from Lincolnshire, told i last month that she pulled out four of her teeth after her NHS dentist went private. Her nearest alternative was 50 miles away with a three-year waiting list. “It was painful and they were growing on each other, so I couldn’t eat at all,” she explained.",
            "Chris Langston, 50, from Shropshire, pulled out a tooth because having it done privately would cost £90 and involve a 60-mile round trip. “I wouldn’t recommend it. Not to anyone. It was horrible,” he said.",
            "Grave doubts over the ‘dental recovery plan’",
            "Given that many of the problems Beth sees are down to people being unable to access dental services, she says: “I would love to work in NHS general practice full-time.” But financially this “wouldn’t be viable”, she laments.",
            "Working in urgent care three days a week, Beth is in a salaried role – receiving around £35,000 a year from the NHS, which she is happy with. But most general practice dentists offering pre-booked appointments to NHS patients in England are self-employed, working under a contract that many feel is neither fair nor financially sustainable. This, they claim, is the main reason for worsening availability.",
            "The contract, introduced in 2006, means they are paid per completed course of treatment. This is banded but makes little allowance for how many procedures a treatment involves, nor how complex or time-consuming they are.",
            "When dentists see neglected mouths needing lots of attention – which is often the case with newly-registered patients – this can leave them out of pocket, says Beth. She has worked under the contract in the past, but would not do so again without radical change.",
            "“The Government has been driving a narrative to make ‘greedy dentists’ look like the villains, saying we’re abandoning the NHS to earn more money,” she argues.",
            "“It’s scary to think this, but you could do a whole day’s work and receive less than the minimum wage, because of the level of need in my county and how the NHS contract works. The system makes it impossible to do that and be able to live comfortably.",
            "“If they need one extraction and a denture, or if they need four root canals, six extractions and dentures, you’re paid the same – and then you have lab fees to pay,” she explains. “You can end up making a loss on some patients.” If all of the patients had severe needs, she would be in trouble.",
            "“I could work five days a week privately – there’s more than enough demand,” she adds. “Or I could work less and spend more time with my family. But I’ve seen how much people really need help. I don’t want to abandon patients with nowhere else to go. I can also see why people move away from the NHS.”",
            "“You could do a whole day’s work and receive less than the minimum wage”",
            "‘Beth’",
            "The prime minister admitted last month that it was “too difficult” to access an NHS dentist. Rishi Sunak recognised that it had been a particular “challenge” in Beth’s region, the south-west of England, but he said he hoped the Government’s £200m dental recovery plan would “fix” the problem.",
            "Up to 240 dentists will be given a £20,000 bonus if they open services in areas with poor NHS availability, and those taking on new patients will receive higher payments. Mobile dental vans will also be introduced for isolated and under-served communities. The Government hopes this “hugely ambitious and far-reaching plan” will lead to 1.5 million more treatments over the next year.",
            "But the BDA says the programme “won’t halt the exodus from the workforce” and fails to offer “real change”. Beth agrees.",
            "“It’s like putting a plaster on a bullet wound,” she says. “The little things they’re bringing in are not going to change the availability of services. They make small tweaks.”",
            "Labour has promised to provide an extra 700,000 urgent dental appointments and reform the NHS dental contract, together with other measures, if it wins the next election. The Nuffield Trust says the proposals “make good sense” but are “unlikely to stem the decline”.",
            "Beth is also angered by the clawback system, with dentists being penalised if they fail to meet strict targets on how many treatments they deliver. “Doctors would never have to pay money back to the NHS for not seeing a certain number of patients – such as when a surgeon sees one patient in a day, but it was a long operation.”",
            "Clawback can also result in “well over 10 per cent of dentistry’s £3bn budget” being lost to other areas of the NHS, according to the BDA. More broadly, the union warns of a “postcode lottery”, with nearly a third of local dental budgets going unspent in some areas of England because struggling practices miss targets.",
            "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told i: “The Government already invests more than £3bn each year to support NHS dentistry and we are starting to see progress. Last year, 1.7 million more adults and around 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist compared to the previous year.",
            "“Our new dental recovery plan, backed by £200m, will create an additional 2.5 million appointments over the next 12 months, including by offering cash incentives to practices to take on new NHS patients.",
            "“We are also strengthening the workforce through the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, which will expand dental undergraduate training places by 40 per cent per year by 2031 to 2032, with an initial 24 per cent increase by 2028 to 2029.”",
            "However, Beth maintains that “propaganda” about the recovery plan is “misleading” for those who have read the news and excitedly ask her if they will soon be able to register with a dentist.",
            "“It must be terrifying to live in a dental desert, like in my county,” she says. “There are literally no NHS practices here taking on new patients. When some children are born, their parents are told they’re going on a 10-year waiting list. In that time, they could have problems that affect their whole lives.",
            "“The system is spectacularly failing a lot of people.”"
